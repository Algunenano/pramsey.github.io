This aught to be fun! I just typed "foss4g" into Google:

[http://www.google.com/search?q=foss4g](http://www.google.com/search?q=foss4g)

And as of now (February 5, 2007), FOSS4G2007 is on the first search page, near the bottom, which is good but not terrific. FOSS4G2006 is #1, which is not surprising. In the middle we have some interesting stuff, like highly regarded blogs that have mentioned FOSS4G recently, or not.

It will be fun to watch the 2007 event climb the page as the buzz grows, month by month!
