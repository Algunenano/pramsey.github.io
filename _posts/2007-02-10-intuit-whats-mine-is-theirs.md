Not a geospatial post, but... I fired up my home accounting software today, to get caught up in preparation for tax time, and look what greeted me:

Intuit is going to shut down all the internet services associated with my copy of Quicken for Mac. But good news! I can upgrade to Quicken 2007 for only $50 and keep my services! Yay!

Holy corporate screwings, Batman!  Nice way to drive the upgrade process, Intuit, but a little tough on the customer loyalty &mdash; I feel like a beast being driven over [Head Smashed In Buffalo Jump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-Smashed-In_Buffalo_Jump).  Gotta make those quarterly numbers.

Time to research alternatives &mdash; deeds like this should not go unpunished.
