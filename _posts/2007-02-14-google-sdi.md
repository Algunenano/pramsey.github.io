I don't know whether to be delighted or frightened, but Google has [put in place](http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2007/02/search-for-kml-in-google-earth.html) the final part of the publish-find-bind contract for a Google SDI.  

Now people can publish their data in the new universal format, Google's [KML](http://earth.google.com/kml/). I can find that data using a Google search. And I can bind to that data using Google's clients &mdash; [Google Earth](http://earth.google.com) and [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com).

I guess this speaks to the importance of a useful working prototype in building out collaborative technology with wide adoption.  If Tim Berners-Lee had been content to just write down the specs for HTTP and HTML, we probably wouldn't have the web (maybe we'd have a huge network built on [gopher](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol))... now that would be cool).  But he didn't just do that, he built a working system at [Cern](http://public.web.cern.ch/PUBLIC/Content/Chapters/AboutCERN/Achievements/WorldWideWeb/WWW-en.html) that did useful stuff with HTTP and HTML, and the people at other sites could take and use too, freely.

Time to retrofit all our software to publish KML!
