Lots of interesting tidbits from the conference organizing front:<ul><li>We have added [Leica Geosystems](http://www.leica-geosystems.com) as a [sponsor](http://2007.foss4g.org). Like [Safe Software](http://www.safe.com), Leica is proprietary software company that makes use of open source in their developments. I'm looking forward to hearing both companies articulate their vision for engaging more with their respective communities.</li><br /><li>I got to take a tour of the [Royal BC Museum](http://www.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/) galleries where we'll be having our Wednesday evening reception.  The [First Peoples Gallery](http://www.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/First_People_Gall/default.aspx) looks great, some amazing totem poles and carvings in the central room, and of course the [Natural History Gallery](http://www.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/Nat_Hist_Gall/default.aspx) has the really cool animal displays my daughter loves so much (oh, the whispered terror of the Mammoth!)</li><br /><li>The [Call for Workshops](http://2007.foss4g.org/workshops) has gone really well, with over 30 submissions so far, and a slight extension to allow a few more to trickle in.  Reading over the evaluations of the 2006 conference, it is clear that the hands-on workshops are what really set FOSS4G apart from other conferences. Yes, sir, sit down at that computer and try out that software &mdash; and take it home with you when you're done, please.</li><br /></ul>
