That sound you just heard was me taking a deep cleansing breath. Aaaaah, phhewhwwhww. The first part of the FOSS4G 2007 program is now in place and online, in advance of the upcoming opening of registration.  (I hope everyone registers early, to keep my blood-pressure down and ulcers in check.)

Workshops are 3 hour hands-on courses on the first day, and require you to specially register for the limited number of seats: [http://2007.foss4g.org/workshops](http://2007.foss4g.org/workshops)

Labs are 1.5 hours sessions, held during the regular program (days two, three and four) and are open to all conference registrants: [http://2007.foss4g.org/labs](http://2007.foss4g.org/labs)
