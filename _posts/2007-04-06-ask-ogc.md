I'm going to Ottawa in 9 days time, to attend the Open Geospatial Consortium technical working group meetings. I expect to randomly blog things of interest, including of course the submission of KML to the OGC. Anyone have any OGC questions they want asked and answered? No guarantees of answers given, mais oui, we can only do what we can do.
