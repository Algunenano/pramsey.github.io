I owe an apology to OGC, and the participants of the Mass Market working group. The post below on KML includes information about preliminary decisions that are not the policy of the OGC until they are officially approved by the higher governing bodies of the OGC. So to Mark and [Carl](http://lists.eogeo.org/pipermail/georss/2007-March/001035.html) and anyone else who has more stress to deal with today than they did yesterday because of me, a heartfelt "I am very very sorry".
