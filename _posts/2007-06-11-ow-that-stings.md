There's a certain backhanded snarkiness to the ESRI UC Q&amp;A item on PostGIS:

> Will ESRI support the PostGIS open-source spatial extension for PostgreSQL?
>
> Yes, ESRI will provide our customers with the option of using either the ISO/OGC spatial type or the PostGIS spatial extension.

So they'll support the standard type or that PostGIS thingymabob. Of course, PostGIS is also an ISO/OGC spatial type, but somehow that fact is a little submerged in the phraseology.
