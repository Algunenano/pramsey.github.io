It is still early days for registration at [FOSS4G](http://2007.foss4g.org/), but one trend is showing up loud and clear &mdash; workshops are popular. Most of the registrants so far have chosen to attend the [Monday hands-on workshops](http://2007.foss4g.org/workshops/). Taking that trend forward, it means the popular workshops will fill up fast, so putting off registration is a good way to lose out on going to workshops.

If you want your pick of the workshop crop, [register now](http://2007.foss4g.org/register/)! Space is literally limited, we only have 240 lab seats to work with.
