In the spirit of [Sean's tomato porn](http://zcologia.com/news/244/tomato-processing/), I give to you, **What Real Strawberries Are Like**.

First, **Real Strawberries** come from very close by, preferably within a few feet of your table, like our front-yard patch:

Second, you pick **Real Strawberries** yourself, off the bush, and when you do, they look like this:

Third, a **Real Strawberry** is a perfect red color, and is perfectly clean right off the bush.  You don't wash **Real Strawberries**, because they don't have anything on them that needs washing:

Finally, **Real Strawberries** are red all the way through, because they are ripe on the bush:

If you are lucky, you can grow enough **Real Strawberries** to have a whole dessert from them, like I did tonight:

Oh, yeah, mmmmmm, **Real Strawberries**, you make life worth living.
