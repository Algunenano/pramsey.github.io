Two weeks ago, we sent out a physical postcard invitation to a list of about 10,000 potential [FOSS4G](http://2007.foss4g.org) attendees in the local region (BC, ALTA, WA, OR, CA) and GIS hotspots (VA, CO).

On Sunday, I sent out a mass email to about 1,000 addresses culled from my personal mail box, web searches, and magazine mailing list purchases.

Monday and Tuesday, the FOSS4G web site recorded the highest number of visitors to date, about a 50% increase over the medium term weekday average.  It's almost like advertising has a purpose.  I feel my universe crumbling.
