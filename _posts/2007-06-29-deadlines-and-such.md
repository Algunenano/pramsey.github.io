The [FOSS4G 2007](http://2007.foss4g.org/) call for presentations deadline has now come and gone, and never have I seen such a large and varied population of procrastinators assembling in one place.  Check out the profile of submissions by day:<pre>     2 | 2007-06-24<br />     2 | 2007-06-25<br />     8 | 2007-06-26<br />    13 | 2007-06-27<br />    39 | 2007-06-28<br />    73 | 2007-06-29</pre>Way to plan ahead guys! Half the presentations submitted in the last two days if the call. 

The final tally of submissions was **213**, which we will have to winnow down to **120** oral presentations and N posters.  You can see the list of submissions as a [KML file](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/abstracts.kml) or an [RSS feed](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/rss.php).
