It's program review time for [FOSS4G 2007](http://2007.foss4g.org)!  In the spirit of open source and Web 2.0, we are looking for the "wisdom of crowds" to help us choose the optimum conference program!  The idea is that everyone who is planning on going to FOSS4G goes to the [program review page](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/review/), goes through a review session, and selects the session of most interest to them.  The committee then uses that information to choose a program and assign things to appropriately sized rooms.

Remember, if you don't participate, you lose out on complaining rights...

The program will be selected July 13, so get your votes in before then!
