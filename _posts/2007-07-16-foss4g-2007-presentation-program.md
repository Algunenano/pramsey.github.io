On Friday I sat down with the conference committee and we selected the [120 presentations](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/html.php) that will make up the middle of the [FOSS4G 2007](http://2007.foss4g.org) program.  We had 217 submissions to choose from, and the job was made *waaaaay* easier by starting from the numbers generated by the community program review.

The review ended up generating 12,000 distinct rankings (a score on a talk) gathered from over 250 reviewers.  Talks ranged in popularity from just over 50% (1 in 2 reviewers indicated they had interest) to 6%.  Perhaps the most surprising thing about the process is that no submission was so unloved as to receive no votes -- even the lowliest submission received 16 expressions of interest.  We are a community with a wide ranges of tastes.
