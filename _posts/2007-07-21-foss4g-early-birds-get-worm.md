Or, perhaps they *avoid* the worm... it all depends on what you think the worm is.

Regardless, the early discounted [registration](http://2007.foss4g.org/register/) rates **end on Friday** and that means a big bump up in cost for those who do their registration at the last minute. Before the deadline, conference registration is just $395CAD; after Friday July 27, registration is $565CAD.
