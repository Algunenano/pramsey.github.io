I [mentioned earlier](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2007/06/foss4g-workshops-in-demand.html) that workshops are the most popular features of FOSS4G, and as we rush into early-bird, the numbers are bearing that out. Already over 2/3 of the slots are full.

Per [usual](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2007/06/deadlines-and-such.html), everyone is waiting until the last possible second to get their registrations in at the reduced rates.  That means if you register now, a whole 24 hours before the deadline, you still have a fighting chance of getting a workshop seat. Go get that credit card. Go on.
