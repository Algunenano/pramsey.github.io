With 450 [registered](http://2007.foss4g.org/register/) as the early bird deadline passes, the 2007 edition of [FOSS4G](http://2007.foss4g.org) is now well positioned for attendance in the 600 to 700 range, easily besting last year's total of 535.  Previous conferences registered up to 50% of their attendees in the last month before the conference, so attendance could go even higher.

Many of the workshops are now at capacity, but there are still a couple left.  Not for long though.  All I need now is Comic Book Guy, or Juan Antonio Samaranch to declare FOSS4G 2007 the "biggest FOSS4G ever!".
