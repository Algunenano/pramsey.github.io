The [results](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2007-August/002158.html) are in, and I am now a freshly minted member of the OSGeo [Board of Directors](http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/Board_of_Directors). Last time out, I plead time constraints and did not stand, but this time I decided to take the plunge.

I think over the last year, OSGeo has proved out some of its promise, most clearly in providing a "voice for the community".  So many organizations &ndash; business, governments, conferences, etc &ndash; require a single point of contact.  Being able to say "we're the point of contact" opens so many doors that would otherwise remain closed.  So I'm looking forward to pushing that aspect of OSGeo forward over the next year.
