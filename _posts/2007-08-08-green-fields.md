One of the points I [make repeatedly](http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=2517) when talking to people about how open source GIS and open source in general are penetrating the marketplace is that open source thrives in "[green fields](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_land)" environments.

"Green fields development" is a real estate term, referring to brand new housing build on previously un-developed land.  I use it to refer to systems that are built fresh without having to fit into pre-existing technology infrastructure.  Usually, green fields developments are undertaken by start-up companies, but sometimes larger companies will allow new developments to choose their own technology baseline.

Linux/Apache really took off as start-ups built out their web serving infrastructure. A whole new application category with no incumbent vendor.  When they evaluated their technology options, start-ups could see Solaris/SunOne as one expensive option, and Windows/IIS as another less expensive option, and Linux/Apache as the least expensive option. Given approximate technical parity (80/20 rule) the choice is clear.

The same thing is happening now with the geo-start-ups. I found very interesting the technology list that Peter Batty laid out in his [musings on a geo-start-up](http://geothought.blogspot.com/2007/08/looking-for-some-top-notch-web.html).  PostgreSQL, PostGIS, Ruby, Python, web services.  All very open, most open source.  And this is an individual with an intimate knowledge of the various technology options available in the geospatial market-place.

We see the same thing in the kinds of people contracting us for work on PostGIS and Mapserver and web mapping apps. They are start-ups. They don't have any built-in vendor biases. They are just choosing the infrastructure with the best price/performance, and open source is what they are choosing.
