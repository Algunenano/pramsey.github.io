By my count, it's just 38 days until [FOSS4G](http://2007.foss4g.org/)! Scary thought, the amount of logistics involved. 

Anyways!

The opening plenary session is now set, with some great [keynoters](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/#keynotes) (Geoff Zeiss, Autodesk; Tyler Mitchell, OSGeo; Peter Rushforth, GeoConnections) and a fabulous feature speaker, [Damian Conway](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/#damianconway).

Also, a full line-up of 5-minute [lightning](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/#lightning) talks, to get the blood circulating! [Peter Batty](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/lightning/#batty), [Raj Singh](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/lightning/#singh), [Schuyler Earle](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/lightning/#earl), [Chris Schmidt](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/lightning/#schmidt), and more!

We had our update from the conference organizer yesterday, and the hotel blocks are almost sold out! Make your [travel](http://2007.foss4g.org/travel/) plans now, otherwise you will be paying higher prices for [accommodations](http://2007.foss4g.org/accommodations/). The hotels are chomping at the bit to take away our block rooms and sell them for more on the open market &mdash; snap them up!
