This Friday, I hopped up from my computer, told it to shutdown, turned off my monitor and hurried home.

This morning, I got in, turned on my monitor and ... my computer was already on.  Huh?  It had never shut down in the first place, because Acrobat Reader doesn't respect Windows telling it to shut down, it only listens to you, the user.  So my Acrobat spent the weekend waiting for me to confirm that *yes, I really wanted it to shut down!*

I wonder how many tonnes should be booked to Adobe for this particular design infraction.
