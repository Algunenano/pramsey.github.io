The conference program has been coming together, piece by piece, over the past several months.  Workshops and labs, keynote speaker, presentations, lightning talks, and demonstrations.  Well, it is all done now, and off to the printer for conversion to dead-tree format.  It's also online in [PDF format](http://2007.foss4g.org/FOSS4G2007_Program.pdf).
