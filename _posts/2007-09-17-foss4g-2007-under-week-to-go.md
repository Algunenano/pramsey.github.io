Disturbingly, the date of the conference just keeps marching relentlessly closer, without consulting me on how much I have left to complete before the big day.

Quick stats: 640+ registered, 318 in workshops, 300+ for banquet, 120 presentation, 28 posters, 12 workshops, 18 labs.

Here's what's going on:

On <span style="font-weight:bold;">Friday</span>, people start to arrive, some of the workshop teachers, other folks from far away who are leaving time to do some tourist stuff and get over jet lag, and so on. I will be sitting down with our organizing company ([Sea To Sky Meetings](http://www.seatoskymeetings.com/)), the Conference Centre staff, the AV contractor staff, and our workshops organizer for a final walk-through of the schedule and all the physical details. How rooms are configured, and when; what food arrives, and where; all that great stuff.

On <span style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday</span>, we have an orientation meeting for volunteers, and stuff delegate bags.  Inserts from exhibitors, the program, maps, some coupons from local attractions and merchants, t-shirts, etc, etc.  Also we move as much stuff into the conference centre as possible (workshop handouts, etc) so we don't have to do it on Sunday.  Meanwhile, the Open Street Map folks will be having a [mapping party](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Victoria_mapping_party) today.

On <span style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday</span>, we take over the conference centre as our lease begins (at noon) and start setting up the [6 full computer labs](http://2007.foss4g.org/program_overview/monday/) needed for the workshops.  The conference really will start to "feel real" at this point, as Registration opens at 3pm and real live delegates will start showing up and picking up their credentials.  Workshop and lab teachers will be coming in through the early evening to check out their class rooms and make sure things work.  Folks should be arriving at the airport and on ferries all day long.  I will be spending much of my day at an OSGeo board meeting.  The Open Street Map [mapping party](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/index.php/Victoria_mapping_party) will be into day two at this point.

On <span style="font-weight:bold;">Monday</span>, things kick off with the workshop sessions. I'm teaching my "[Introduction to PostGIS](http://2007.foss4g.org/workshops/W-04/)" class in the morning, to 84 hopefully enthusiastic pupils.  About 50% of the delegates will be attending workshops, so the other 50% will presumably still be arriving and registering as the day goes on.  The [exhibitors](http://2007.foss4g.org/exhibition/) will also be hard at work, putting up their displays and getting the integration showcase up and running.  I'll probably go help with that during the afternoon.  At the end of the day, the [OSGeo general meeting](http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/AGM_2007) goes in the Lecture Theatre (a [really pretty](http://victoriaconference.com/tour_theatre.php) room), and simultaneously the workshops team has to tear down 4 of the 6 classrooms to make space for presentations the next day.  The remaining 2 classrooms will be used for [labs](http://2007.foss4g.org/labs/) during the rest of the week.  After the AGM, everyone will converge on the [Sticky Wicket](http://2007.foss4g.org/events/) for beers, turning it into a chaotic madhouse.

By this time, having spent Sunday at a board meeting, taught a 3-hour class, and spent the remainder of the day talking continuously, greeting people, and spending a couple hours at the Wicket, I expect my voice will be shot.  I find I don't talk all that much in my day-to-day life, so transitioning from Quiet Paul to Talking All The Time Conference Paul means that I basically thrash my vocal cords in the first 24 hours and spend the remaining days whispering as loud as I can.

<span style="font-weight:bold;">Tuesday</span>, plenary day! As conference chair, I get to greet the assembled hordes, and serve as MC during the plenary session. [Howard Butler](http://www.hobu.net) will take up the mic to host the [lightning talks](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/#lightning).  I'm really looking forward to [Damian Conway](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/#damianconway)'s talk, having seen him at OSCON some years ago. That OSCON talk felt like a Full Brain Massage, with equal measures of humour, crazy puzzles, and great observations. Then talks and labs begin! I have a talk right away in the Lecture Theatre, my oh-so-popular "[Survey of Open Source GIS](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=136)", which I will once again try-and-fail to shoehorn into 25 minutes. Perhaps I will just collapse in a heap on Tuesday evening, but I imagine I will have one or five business meetings to do. I hope visitors have a sunny evening and take a walk to [Fisherman's Wharf or the Ogden Point Breakwater](http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/FOSS4G2007_Tourism#Must-see_places.2C_features.2C_etc.) and don't spend their whole evening in [BoF sessions](http://wiki.osgeo.org/index.php/FOSS4G2007_BOF_Sessions).

By <span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday</span>, things will be cruising along, with a full day of presentations, demos, exhibition hall, and the [poster](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/posters/) presentation at lunch time.  Everyone will be in town, folks will be relaxed and settled in, and there's a [huge number of talks to choose from](http://2007.foss4g.org/program_overview/wednesday/).  I'll be speaking yet again, this time doing a "[PostGIS Introduction and Case Studies](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=113)" talk, and followed by my colleague Kevin Neufeld's excellent (he did a test run last Friday) "[PostGIS for Power Users](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=117)" talk.  Wednesday evening, about 50% of the attendees have signed up for the evening Banquet at the [Royal BC Museum](http://www.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/). We'll be starting with a private IMAX screening of [Titanica](http://www.imaxvictoria.com/titanica/), then heading to the third floor galleries for [First Nations art](http://www.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/First_People_Gall/default.aspx), [Victoria history](http://www.royalbcmuseum.bc.ca/Mod_Hist_Gall/default.aspx), and lots of yummy food.

On <span style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday</span>, we [wind things down](http://2007.foss4g.org/program_overview/thursday/), with a morning of presentations, labs and demos, and then the closing plenary.  Again, MC duties fall to me, but I will get to lean on Adena Schutzberg, who is going to lead our [closing panel](http://2007.foss4g.org/plenaries/#panel), and then do a little conference re-cap for our entertainment.  The workshop committee will spring into action one last time, and tear down the remaining 2 classrooms, and the exhibitors will all clear out, and the conference centre will fall silent.  Lots of folks will head home at this point, but some developers will remain...

For the <span style="font-weight:bold;">Friday</span> [code sprint](http://2007.foss4g.org/code_sprint/)!
