It's a hard week to be an American in Canada, with the US greenback falling to a 30 year low against the Canadian dollar.  When the US Federal reserve cut interest rates yesterday, the loonie piled on another cent-and-a-half.  All this adds up to some expensive beers for American delegates at [FOSS4G](http://2007.foss4g.org/), sorry guys!  Back when I started planning in January, it was looking like a much cheaper trip for you folks.
