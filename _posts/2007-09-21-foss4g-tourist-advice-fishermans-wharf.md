Fisherman's Wharf [[Map]](http://maps.google.com/maps?q=300+St+Lawrence+St,+Victoria,+BC,+Canada+(Fisherman's+Wharf)) used to be a little rougher, but it is now solidly on the tourist track.  This is not a bad thing, because it caps a nice walk from downtown out along the shore of the Inner Harbour.

Start downtown and walk along the Inner Harbour, keeping the water on your right hand side. If you keep right all the way, you'll find a nice short-side route with some lovely views of the harbour. Eventually, you'll come out at the end of the route, which is Fisherman's Wharf (you'll have to traverse a bit of parking lot at the end).

The Wharf is home to a pretty community of float homes, a few floating take-out restaurants, and a couple of very satisfied harbour seals (well, they live underneath).  The fish store sells scraps for seal feeding, which is fun.  Twirl your fish scrap above the seal, and he will obligingly do a twirl for you &ndash; yes, they are that habituated.

You can take the [Harbour Ferry](http://www.victoriaharbourferry.com/) home from the Wharf to the docks below the Empress, which is a pretty ride and a chance to see the city from a different vantage point.
