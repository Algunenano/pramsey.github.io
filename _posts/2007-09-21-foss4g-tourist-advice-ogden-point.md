One of the pleasures of living in Victoria is taking a stroll along the Ogden Point Breakwater [[Map]](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=48.4152%2c-123.3847&om=1&t=k&z=17).  The breakwater protects the "outer harbour" where the cruise ships dock (where the old Canadian Pacific steamers used to dock) from the rough waters and weather of the Straight of Juan de Fuca just beyond.

It's about a 15 minute walk from the Legislature downtown to the breakwater.  Walk down Belleville Street away from the Empress to Oswego Street, turn left, walk Oswego to the water, turn right, walk along the water to the foot of the breakwater.

The breakwater is open to walking from dawn to dusk, and is about 1km from the shore to the lighthouse at the end.  Being "out in the ocean" provides unobstructed views of the Olympic mountains to the south in Washington, and the Sooke Hills to the west.  It is also common to see wildlife hanging out on the inner side of the breakwater &ndash; harbour seals, blue herons, and sea otters.

After your stroll, you can pop into the Ogden Point Cafe, which sits at the foot of the breakwater and have a coffee and a dessert.  The views from the Cafe are very nice too.
