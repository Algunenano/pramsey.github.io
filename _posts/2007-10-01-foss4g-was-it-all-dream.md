Just a week ago, I was addressing the opening plenary session at FOSS4G! It all feels like a blur now, and it is very hard to remember anything distinctly.

Ironically, for all the talking and speaking I did, the things I remember most clearly are the few talks I had time to get into, and listen quietly, on [pgRouting](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=84), and the new [spatial ETL](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=227) tool from Camptocamp.  Perhaps because these are the two talks where I learned something new and interesting.  The rest was just reciting things I already knew, which is interesting perhaps (I hope) for those on the receiving end, but less stimulating for me.

I walked through the conference centre on the way home from work yesterday... it was shut tight, sadly quiet, and geek-free.

Meanwhile, the second geospatial conference in as many weeks ran today. Make of it what you will. :)
