**Note:** In the spirit of my own criticism, I won't delete this post, but apparently the problem at Directions is technical (lost comments) not political (deleted comments) so I am completely out-to-lunch and offer apologies to Directions! Fool == Me. Ignore the below.*

The Directions Magazine [news item](http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=2556) on which the owner of Blue Marble Geographics was [caught posing as a Blue Marble customer](/2007/09/snow-job-in-september.html) in the comments section has been purged of its comments.  The internet is such a fickle place... down the memory hole we go!
