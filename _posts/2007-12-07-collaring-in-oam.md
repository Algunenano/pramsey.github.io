Collaring can pre-exist in images that have been masked prior to delivery, or can be generated by the process of re-projection, as the spare pixels in the target system get filled in with "no data" values.

Sean [uploaded some data](http://zcologia.com/news/627/openaerialmap-fort-collins/) from his home town of Fort Collins, and the OAM process to reproject it into the global OAM scheme (lat/lon?) collared it, which shows up at the edges of the data.

There are some [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/) tricks to make the collars transparent, but if there's some blank "no data" areas in the source imagery, it is hard to avoid it. [OSSIM](http://www.ossim.org/) has some more advanced mosaicking capabilities that might fit the OAM processing needs better than GDAL.
