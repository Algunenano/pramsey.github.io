The news that a [third center-line road data provider](http://www.facet-tech.com/News/Facet_Announces_Navigation_Content_for_the_Continental_US.htm) is starting up is very interesting. In an [interview with Directions](http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=2643) they are relatively closed-lipped about why they think they can compete with the [big](http://www.navteq.com) [boys](http://www.teleatlas.com), but a good guess can be had by looking at their earlier news releases.  This not a road mapping company, this is a computer vision company.  Presumably the liberal application of computer vision allows them to combine their GPS and intertial data with road sign readings to build out full navigation-restricted data without a heavy manual data post-processing step.

That still leaves the tricky aspect of actually driving their cars down every street in the country, and I wonder what mapping source they used to ensure they weren't missing any.  The mathematics of driving every road in the country are also daunting: 4 million miles of roads in the USA, at an average speed of 20 miles per hour, for 8 hours a day, implies 25,000 days of driving! Or $2M using $10/hour drivers, plus the capital cost (at least $5M) of the 70+ vehicles needed to do the thing in about a year.

On the other hand, given that [Nokia just paid $8B for NavTeq](http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/071206/nokia_navteq_antitrust.html?.v=1), the cost of entry into this marketplace is incredibly low &mdash; $20M maybe?  I think I'm in the wrong business, time to hit the road!
