Good news from down Redmond way. The SQL Server spatial team has [decided](http://blogs.msdn.com/isaac/archive/2007/12/27/latitude-longitude-ordering.aspx) to make the coordinate order returned by their STAsText and STAsBinary functions consistent with the existing industry practice: (easting, northing) or (longitude, latitude) or (x, y), depending on how you look at it.

That kind of community responsiveness practically cries out for... a [five pound box of chocolates](http://www.rogerschocolates.com/products.php?category_id=12&page=1&search=&product_id=5470411621727d756f86f5b7957c378bd)!  Note to Isaac and company: don't eat them all in one sitting, no matter how tempting it might be!
