I am a sucker for catastrophe, so I am fortunate to live in this age of (as the Chinese might say) "opportunity".  We are privileged to be witness to the twin cataclysms of [peak oil](http://theoildrum.com/) and [global warming](http://www.climatecrisis.net/).  It may not have the immediacy and drama of the [sack of Rome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sack_of_Rome_%28410%29) but, baby, it's got **size**.

In the past year, I finally got to see "An Inconvenient Truth", which really is worth seeing, even if you know all about global warming already, because it is such a clean compendium of all the issues, scientific, political, cultural, that we are navigating on our way into this crisis.  It brings everything into a neat package, tied with a bow, a truly great work of documentary film making.

However, the real eye-opener for me in the last year was an under-appreciated article in the New Yorker, "[The Darkening Sea](http://igbp-scor.pages.unibe.ch/gfx/NewYorker.pdf)" by [Elizabeth Kolbert](http://www.grist.org/news/maindish/2006/04/10/roberts/).  The gist of the article is that by changing atmospheric chemistry (by injecting CO<sub>2</sub> in higher concentrations) we are also changing oceanic chemistry (as the oceans absorb the extra CO<sub>2</sub>).  The eye-opener is just how deep through the ecosystem this change in ocean chemistry reaches.  I cannot recommend this article highly enough, it's one of the best of the last couple years.
