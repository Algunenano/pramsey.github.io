Moving on:

<blockquote>2. Risk: Our landscape is changing so fast there is an extreme amount of exposure to dumping resources into a solution that isn’t supported. If any one component of the enterprise stack changes you’re vulnerable and I trust those I’m paying to cover my maintenance than I do an ethereal community. When it comes to supporting my clientele I need tangible support resources. How good are the support resources for open source solutions? Is there comprehensive up to <img src="http://www.consumer-action.org/archive/English/ConsumerRights/1997_HowToComplain_California/1997_HowToComplainCover.gif" width="162" height="260" style="float:right;margin:7px;" />date documentation? Can I call someone in an a oh $*!&% moment?</blockquote>

I think [this article at InformationWeek](http://www.informationweek.com/shared/printableArticle.jhtml?articleID=180207025) (number three in the Google search for [&ldquo;open source support&rdquo;](http://www.google.ca/search?q=open+source+support)) sums it up well.  There is not **one** answer, there are a number of answers, and you need to choose the one(s) that make sense for your needs.<ul><li>Product support, from specialist companies with expertise in particular components (Refractions for PostGIS, DM Solutions for Mapserver, TOPP for Geoserver)<li>Stack support, from generalist companies putting together mixes of components (Wheregroup)<li>Community support, much maligned, but better than the technical support provided with most proprietary packages<li>Training, from folks like the companies above, or specialist trainers like Open Technology Group<li>Hiring project developers, an often unappreciated source of top notch trouble shooting and knowledge,<li>Consultants, who have to know the tools they use</ul>For me, the money quote is:

<blockquote>CIOs would be well-advised not to buck the open-source trend. On the contrary, they should assume responsibility for open-source initiatives and ensure that their companies have the right support structures in place... They'll find the more mature an open-source software project, the more mature support options its users enjoy.</blockquote>

Open source requires you to **assume responsibility**, which is hard for an organization man, with years of CYA behind him, to do. In exchange for taking responsibility for your own infrastructure, you are rewarded with a software ecosystem where there is more than one source of support.

What do open source organizations do when their support provider isn't up to snuff? They get a new support provider.

What do ESRI customers do when ESRI support isn't up to snuff? They [bitch about it on James Fee's blog](http://www.spatiallyadjusted.com/2005/12/14/yea-im-looking-at-mapserver-enterprise/).
