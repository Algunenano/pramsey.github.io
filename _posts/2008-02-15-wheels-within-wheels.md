Sean says he supported Obama [because he is more &ldquo;electable&rdquo;](http://zcologia.com/news/673/getting-political/).  So, what are we to make of [this notice](http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/15/us/politics/15finance.html) in the New York Times?

<blockquote><img src="http://www.autocarparts.com/images/Skunk2/cam_gears.jpg" width="212" height="167" style="float:right;border-width:0" />Senator John McCainâ€™s presidential campaign said Thursday that it stood by a year-old pledge made with Senator Barack Obama that each would accept public financing for the general election if the nominee of the opposing party did the same.</blockquote>

This isn't about campaign financing, since that issue would keep until after the Democratic nominee is decided. This is about pumping up Obama by treating him like the presumptive nominee, putting let more wind in his sails heading into Texas and Ohio, where an Obama win will put a stake through the heart of the Clinton campaign.  Could it be the McCain campaign doesn't share Sean's take on who the more electable Democrat is?
