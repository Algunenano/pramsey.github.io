Good analysis in a [sarcastic candy coating](http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2008/02/borg-makes-nice-with-open-source-oh.html):

> Open source has ridden the classic Gartner hype cycle. Three years ago was the "peak of inflated expectations," and VCs would fund anything with "open source" in its name or business plan. Now the cycle has moved on to the "trough of disillusionment." Reality has set in. Nobody is making money. They're in the Slough of Despond.

Bear in mind that FakeSteve is the Voice of the Valley, and measures using the standard Valley metrics: VC funding, license sales, lines of copy in Fortune.  Open source has been through two hype cycles now (from cycle one, remember the VA Linux IPO?) and keeps on trucking.  There are more things in heaven and earth, FakeSteve, than are dreamt of in the Valley.
