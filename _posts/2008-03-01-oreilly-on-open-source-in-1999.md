It is more than a little disturbing that both the myths and the explanations in this [nearly-10-year-old article](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/opensource/news/myths_1199.html) have remained so constant.  Here are the myths:

* It's all about Linux versus Windows, with Red Hat as yet another challenger to Microsoft.
* Open Source Software Isn't Reliable or Supported.
* Big companies don't use open source software.
* Open Source is hostile to intellectual property.
* Open Source is all about licenses.
* If I give away my software to the open source community, thousands of developers will suddenly start working for me for nothing.
* Open source only matters to programmers, since most users never look under the hood anyway.
* There's No Money to be Made on Free Software.
* The Open Source movement isn't sustainable, since people will stop developing free software once they see others making lots of money from their efforts.
* Open Source is playing catch up to Microsoft and the commercial world.
