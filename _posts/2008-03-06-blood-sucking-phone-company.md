So, I'm sitting in SeaTac, minding my own business, drinking a cup of tea (SeaTac travel tip: free WiFi at Tully's coffee with purchase) and my phone rings.  It is my (god forsaken, soul sucking, devil worshipping) cell-phone company. They want to give me a free phone! It's quad band! It's got a great camera! I'm a preferred customer, so it's only $10 (for a $300 phone!) and comes with a second line.

Well, having been [screwed before](/2008/02/like-cattle-to-slaughter.html), my ears perk up. What is this second line, of which you speak?  "Oh, you get unlimited minutes for three months, sir!"  And after three months?  "We can get you a couples package."  Well, fabulous.  Another up-sell. Thanks, but no thanks, and take your fabulous phone with you.

It's a good thing they weren't offering me an [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/), or I would have cracked.
