One of the things I wanted to do after moving on from Refractions was get back into technology in a "hands on" way again, and the place I most want to get my hands dirty is with PostGIS.  It's all very nice to be a technology evangelist, but very frustrating to have to depend entirely on others to get things implemented.  I have to be my own staff now, and that means if I want to play with the guts of PostGIS, I have to learn C.

So that's what I'm doing. I have my book. I work through exercises. I read the PostGIS code. It's a slow process, but rewarding as my understanding grows.

For those of you who, like me, have mostly worked in higher level languages, I want to share my C "wow" moment for the week.  C has arrays. The syntax is the same as (surprise) all those other languages (Java, Perl, Javascript, PHP) that ape C syntax.  Want to iterate through an array? No problem, very familiar, we print out the contents of our array:

    for( i = 0; i < sizeof(array); i++ ) {
       printf( "%d\n", array[i] );
    }

Now, I knew C pointers were much less abstract than Java pointers, they actually point to memory addresses.  Even so, there's knowing and then there is **KNOWING**. This routine, that also prints the contents of the array, blew my mind:

    for( i = 0; i < sizeof(array); i++ ) {
         printf( "%d\n", *(array + i) );
    }

WTF!?!  

First, it turns out that the value of the bare "array" variable is just a pointer to the front of the array (how efficient). But the icing on the cake is that you can do math on the pointers!  I add 1 to the pointer, and now it's pointing at the next element, so when I dereference the pointer (with that *) out pops the next value!

All you CompSci majors can have a laugh at my expense ("technopeasant!"), but I'm self-taught, and I have been living in other people's (Perl, Java, PHP, Avenue (!!!), Javascript) interpreters for many years.  This stuff is too cool.
