Very odd. This evening, I want to read Chris Schmidt's latest blog post, and what I saw was this:

<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3036/2423986571_5d83d29348.jpg" />

What? Apparently Chris is distributing "badware". I'll be interested to see how this shakes up, if Chris' site got schmutzed or if the "anti-phishing site" Firefox is [aligned with](http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/06/firefox-3-will-include-malware.html) made a mistake.

What is **very odd** is that Firefox resolutely refuses to take me to Chris' site.  Safari, on the other hand, cannot display anything at all from the site, which perhaps means "bad things afoot". Glad I am not Chris' sysadmin tonight (or Chris, assuming sysadmin == Chris).
