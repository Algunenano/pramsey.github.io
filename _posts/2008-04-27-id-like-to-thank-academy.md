But mostly Howard Butler for nominating me and the rest of the Mapserver PSC for accepting me as a [Mapserver committer](http://www.nabble.com/Motion%3A-Nominate-Paul-Ramsey-for-SVN-commit-access-td16887843.html).  I guess my [crazy ideas](http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/development/rfc/ms-rfc-43/) and [cockeyed schemes](http://trac.osgeo.org/mapserver/ticket/2282) didn't scare them off!

You like me! You really like me!
