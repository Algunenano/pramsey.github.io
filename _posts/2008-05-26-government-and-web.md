[Matt Ball](vector1media.com/spatialsustain/) recently pointed out an article coming to press at the Yale Journal of Law and Technology, titled "[Government Data and the Invisible Hand](http://www.yjolt.org/11/fall/robinson-0)".  Since I just got back from San Francisco, where I gave a talk titled "[Robocop: Public Service in the Internet Age](http://s3.cleverelephant.ca/baama-2008.pdf)", it feels like the universe is vibrating on a particular wave length right now, saying

> "free your data, let the world play in your garden!"

My talk was itself organized around the ideas presented in the UK "[Power of Information](http://www.cleverelephant.ca/uk_power_information.pdf)" report, which I learned about from a high level civil servant in the BC government.  

Vibrate, universe, vibrate!

Coles notes of my talk:

* public service
* on the internet
* is a new medium
* it requires a new approach
* serve online communities
* serve alternative users of information
* provide open access to your information
* remove policy barriers
* expect re-use, encourage it
* use standard formats
* *become **part of the internet***
