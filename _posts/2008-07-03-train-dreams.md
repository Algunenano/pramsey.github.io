The web is littered with half-baked train "projects" that need little more than some love, public support, and a couple billion dollars to get off the ground.  Vector1 gives us a particularly fluffy example today, the [solar train](http://vector1media.com/spatialsustain/?p=796).  But why stop there? Here's a gallery of not-gonna-happen/didn't-happen rail "proposals" culled in just a few minutes from the Goog:

* [Baltimore/Washington Maglev](http://www.bwmaglev.com/), last updated, 2003!
* [California Maglev Project](http://sdlamaglev.org/index.htm), it floats, see, right over the rails!
* [California High Speed Rail](http://www.cahighspeedrail.ca.gov/), an actual .gov! Check out the top news item, "House Bill Could Breathe Life into California High-Speed Rail". That's right, it "could breath life" into the project! Whee!
* [Alberta High Speed Rail (2005)](http://www.bowpartnership.ca/rail/httpdocs/), yep, 2005.
* [Midwest High Speed Rail Association](http://www.midwesthsr.org/il_fastTrack.htm), right in President Obama's back yard, it can't lose (am I getting ahead of myself here?)
* [Texas TGV](http://www.trainweb.org/tgvpages/texastgv.html), great alliteration, but you can't run a *train Ã  grande vitesse* in Texas, it just ain't American! Now the *Freedom Train*, that I would ride!
* [Florida Overland Express](http://www.cefa.fsu.edu/FOX.html), another great acronym, but RIP, 1996.

Some of these attempts actually spent millions (like the Texas TGV), but they all met/are meeting the same fate. Millions won't do it, try billions, guys. That's what it took to build the continental railway system in the first place, in a [financial bubble](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.02/bubbles.html) worthy of the dot-com era &ndash; and don't forget, generous government subsidies [via land grants](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Railway_Acts).

Meanwhile, freight rail in North America is going strong, [stronger than Europe](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/02/europe-off-the-rails/), even! But before passenger rail takes off, North Americans need to be willing to park their cars. So far, the gas price surge has only generated a surge of news stories on more efficient cars, electric cars, and small cars. But very few stories about *not using your car*.
