Who is building the [GeoWeb](http://www.geoweb.org/)? Must be the GeoSpider! Spinning it with GeoSilk!<img src="http://www.alanbauer.com/images/Patterns%20in%20Nature/Spider%20web%20with%20dew.jpg" style="float:right; padding:10px; width:300px; height:202px;">

I'll be talking at GeoWeb about [Mapserver](http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu/), an important piece of GeoSilk, in a [no-holds-barred panel](http://geowebconference.org/program/spark-panel-sessions) with representatives from GeoServer (Justin Deoliveira) and MapGuide (Bob Bray). Yes, we're in a bit of an open source ghetto &ndash; it would have been better to get all the functionally similar products in one room, and only let the victor out alive.

Mapserver! Strong like ox! Fast like cheetah!
