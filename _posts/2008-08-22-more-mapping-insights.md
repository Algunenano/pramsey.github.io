From [Andrew Turner](http://highearthorbit.com/visualizing-restaurant-searching/), the [Urban Spoon spatial-temporal map](http://www.urbanspoon.com/iphone/24hours) of restaurant seeking. Among the insights you can glean from this data presentation:

* People look for restaurants in cities full of people, not in the wilderness.
* People don't look for restaurants when they are asleep.

Perhaps a zoomed in view of San Francisco would be more interesting.
