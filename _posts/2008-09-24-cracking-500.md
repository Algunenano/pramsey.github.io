It looks like the 2008 edition of FOSS4G (going on next week!) in Cape Town, South Africa is [going to crack 500 attendees](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/foss4g2008loc/2008-September/000624.html).  This is a great showing for an event which has had to overcome substantial distance from the FOSS4G centers of gravity in North America and Europe. And, supporting the theme of "An Option for Developing Countries", a large proportion of registrants are South African.  So lots of folks will be learning about open source geo-spatial next week, and taking it back to their communities.

As usual, I am suffering non-buyers-remorse as an exciting event that I won't be attending approaches. However, with the family so wee (1.5 and 4), going away for well over a week just isn't on right now.
