How could the bailout fail to pass Congress, when it had been negotiated and promoted by the leadership of both parties? Easy, it's the tragedy of the commons! If I may enter the head of the Representative from South Jesusland, Phil I. Buster:

<blockquote>"If I vote for this, my constituents who hate Wall Street (and that's a lot of them) will hate *me*!"<br />"But if this fails, the economy could crumble, and they'll hate me *more*!"<br />"But if vote against it, and it passes, I win both ways! Hate Wall Street? I voted against it! Economy does OK? Who's going to remember or care how I voted? Economy crumbles? It was a bad plan anyways!"</blockquote>

Multiply by a few hundred Representatives with fingers in the wind and voila! No plan, Dow tanks 700.

<small>No, this isn't geospatial, but I find it *really interesting*! Like having my liver removed while fully conscious.</small>
