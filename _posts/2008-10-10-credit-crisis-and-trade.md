I found [this item](http://www.financialpost.com/story.html?id=866522) today, particularly chilling:

<blockquote>The credit crisis is spilling over into the grain industry as international buyers find themselves unable to come up with payment, forcing sellers to shoulder often substantial losses.

Before cargoes can be loaded at port, buyers typically must produce proof they are good for the money. But more deals are falling through as sellers decide they don't trust the financial institution named in the buyer's letter of credit, analysts said.</blockquote>

I think everyone should take a deep breath and go read [Roosevelt's first inaugural](http://www.yale.edu/lawweb/avalon/presiden/inaug/froos1.htm), both for a perspective on how much worse things can get, and the mindset needed to address these things.

<blockquote>So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance. In every dark hour of our national life a leadership of frankness and vigor has met with that understanding and support of the people themselves which is essential to victory. I am convinced that you will again give that support to leadership in these critical days.

In such a spirit on my part and on yours we face our common difficulties. They concern, thank God, only material things. Values have shrunken to fantastic levels; taxes have risen; our ability to pay has fallen; government of all kinds is faced by serious curtailment of income; the means of exchange are frozen in the currents of trade; the withered leaves of industrial enterprise lie on every side; farmers find no markets for their produce; the savings of many years in thousands of families are gone. </blockquote>

And it goes on... For something delivered 75 years ago, it feels surprisingly topical.
