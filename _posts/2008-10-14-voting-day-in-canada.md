Happy voting day, Canadians. I'm just about to head out my local polling place to nullify somebody's vote by casting an equal, opposite vote (I like to identify them in line, for maximum enragement. "Oh, you're voting Conservative? I'm voting NDP, so you might as well have not even bothered coming.")<img src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3052/2942352590_d920d9f5a2_m.jpg" style="float:right; padding:5px;" />

I wouldn't be a Canadian if I didn't take this opportunity to point out how this day demonstrates (yet again) how superior we are to our cousins to the south. We started our election later than them (September 9), but we're still finishing first. I will not have to spend three hours in line to vote. I will vote using a pencil and paper, not a touch screen doohickey. We have four national parties to choose from (five, if you're from Quebec and think Quebec is a nation) instead of two. We also have lots of other great options on the ballot, for those who like to get off the beaten path (see right). And we don't just have hockey moms running for office, but honest-to-god [hockey players](http://kendryden.liberal.ca/).
