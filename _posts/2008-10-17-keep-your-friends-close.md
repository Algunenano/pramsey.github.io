And your enemies *closer*. It seems ESRI has [yet to learn](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2008-October/004489.html) that particular piece of the wisdom of Sun-tzu, and that's too bad. By excluding "competitors" that are very small compared to the overall marketplace, ESRI is being penny-wise and pound foolish. Sure, open source will steal a few accounts here and there, but the real prize is to co-opt them into your ecosystem, where you can keep an eye on them, a lesson Microsoft has [clearly learned](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-10068367-56.html?tag=nl.e703).
