One of the stranger rituals you will come across in Victoria is the annual fish stencil that the staff at the [Goldstream Provincial Park](http://www.goldstreampark.com/) put on for the kids every year during the salmon run. This is no ordinary fish stencil, because at Goldstream they use real dead salmon as the template.

Paint your fish, press a sheet of paper onto it, and voila, instant fish keepsake. If you come to Victoria in the late-October to early-November period, make sure Goldstream (just 20 minutes outside town) is on your agenda.
