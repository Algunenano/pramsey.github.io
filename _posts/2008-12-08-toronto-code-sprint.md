Last month, over beers in [Lawrence, Kansas](/2008/11/we-arent-in-kansas-anymore-toto.html), I had a discussion with Steve Lime and Howard Butler about what a good Mapserver code sprint might look like.  And when I got home, I decided to see if we could have a code sprint sort of like that: central location, focussed on the "C tribe" of open source software applications, in the off season for reasonable cost.

With lots of work from Tom Kralidis in Toronto, we now have all the pieces in place for a [Toronto code sprint](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Toronto_Code_Sprint_2009) this winter from March 7-10.  We are expecting about 20 of the key contributors to projects like Mapserver, GDAL, PostGIS, GEOS, QGIS, and Proj4 to be in attendance, for a brain-busting four days.

We are also looking for a few sponsors to help cover the modest expenses associated with a venue, internet and catering during the sprint. If your organization has $500 to spare and wants to curry favor with some of the more influential folks in open source geospatial, please get in touch with me, or just add your name to the list of sponsors on the [wiki page](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Toronto_Code_Sprint_2009) and I'll get in touch with *you*.

**Update:** We've now received sponsorship from [Rich Greenwood](http://www.greenwoodmap.com/), [OSGIS.nl](http://www.osgis.nl/index_en.htm), [Coordinate Solutions](http://www.coordinatesolutions.com), [LizardTech](http://www.lizardtech.com/), and [SJ Geophysics](http://www.sjgeophysics.com/), thanks so much everybody!
