[Sean thinks](http://sgillies.net/blog/848/surging) the OGC-based GeoWeb isn't showing particularly stellar growth, [press releases](http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/5127-On-the-Surge-in-OGC-SDI.html) notwithstanding.

Google bears him out: [http://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:request=getcapabilities](http://www.google.com/search?q=inurl:request=getcapabilities)

The number of results returned from this search isn't moving up all that fast.
