What are the physical manifestations of a recession? Here's one: the copy of Wired I bought when starting out my travel day is fully 50% thinner than the one I bought on my last trip (I tend to only read Wired on airplanes).

What other visible signifiers are there? In the long run, Paul Krugman [provides](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/use-delay-and-obsolescence/) a [depressing theory](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/02/13/use-delay-and-obsolescence/) as to what will end this slump -- the eventual decay of our physical infrastructure will become so extensive that the effort involved in replacing it will initiate recovery.
