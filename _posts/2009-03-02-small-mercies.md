One of the "nice" things about having already lost most of ones investment portfolio is that further drops in the market aren't nearly so emotionally distressing.  5% of the original investment, that was worth fretting about. 5% of what's left? Meh.

I have become, in the words of the rock dude, comfortably numb.

**Update:** Good thing I'm in it for the long term. Oh, wait a [minute](http://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/02/irrational-after-all/).
