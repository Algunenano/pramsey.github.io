...living life in peeeace! Woohoo! HoooOoo. You may say, I'm dreamer...

I started skimming [this piece](http://www.cadmaps.com/gisblog/?p=54), and apparently the new Silverlight map control is awesome, and it was all very Microsofty, but I kept on reading because learning is good for me and then

**BAM!** 

he's pulling tracking data out of a PostGIS database into his Silverlight control, and then

**POW!**

he's doing it with GeoServer and GeoWebCache, holy cow you can put this stuff together like that, open source and Microsoft, and peanut butter and pickles, and you just eat it, are you insane?

And when I woke up I had a terrible headache and my wallet was missing.

Awesome article.
