Little did I know that this would cause me to be sent through the "special line" at customs: the daffodil is an agricultural product.

On the up-side the officers were uniformly good humored and enjoyable and basically waved me through (who can be cross with a man with a daffodil from his daughter?) so it was actually a positive in an otherwise normal drab transit of SeaTac.
