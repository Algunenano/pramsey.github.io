I love the idea of a geo-conference where most of the attendees are not in the government/land management/asset management realm. Unfortunately, trivial matters like the births of children and so on have gotten in the way of my attending, thus far. But not this year! This time out, I'm going to Where, and I'm going to be teaching a [short course on spatial databases](http://en.oreilly.com/where2009/public/schedule/detail/7188). Spatial SQL is a powerful tool, so powerful that you don't require much more than a spatial database and a web mapping API to do some nifty stuff. [OSGeo](http://www.osgeo.org) will have a booth this year, so if you're at Where and you want to talk databases, track me down there.

**Reminder:** If you're reading this before Wednesday, you still have time to register before the early bird rates go away.
