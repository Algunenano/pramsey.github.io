Someone, please call the [FTC](http://www.ftc.gov/bc/index.shtml)! I may [post my blog](/) on Google, store my [mail and calendar and notes](https://www.google.com/a/) on Google, teach people how to [make maps](http://maps.google.com/) using Google, but even I have my limits.

The [Google Profile](http://www.google.com/profiles/) leverages Google *search monopoly* (you listening, FTC?!?!) into a you-must-join social network. I like [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/0/134/717) as a professional social network, but this is going to blow all that out of the water. Want to be found? To control your professional image? Yes, having a decent [personal site](http://www.cleverelephant.ca/) will still be important, but now the starting point for a personal search ([Google Search](http://www.google.com/search?q=%22paul+ramsey%22)) is also the end point ([Google Profile](http://www.google.com/profiles/104603475669025566195)).

Can you afford to not have Google Profile? I don't think I can, and I think that stinks.

**Update:** Apparently I wasn't clear about my point: because Google controls search, their Profile is a must-have for anyone who expects to be looked up on the internet (independent contractors, mobile professionals, me). It is not optional. It's a Google world. Comply.
