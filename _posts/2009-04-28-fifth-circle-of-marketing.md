What have I been doing for the past month? Not much PostGIS, as the growing list of [1.4 milestone issues](http://trac.osgeo.org/postgis/query?status=new&status=assigned&status=reopened&milestone=postgis+1.4.0&milestone=postgis+1.4.1&order=priority) attests. Mostly residing in the fifth circle of marketing &ndash; [web content](http://opengeo.org/).
