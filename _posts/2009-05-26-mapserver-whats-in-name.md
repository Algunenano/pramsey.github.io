In an otherwise unrelated conversation, Howard Butler produced this short quote on effective software project names:

> A name need not describe what something does (MapServer, I stare in your general direction :), but it needs to be distinctive enough to discriminate ...

This reminded me of the ArcGIS Server demo at Where 2.0, the [Jack-and-Jeremy](http://where.blip.tv/file/2151502/) show (by the way, IRC consensus was that Jeremy Rocks, too bad he was off-line (and on-stage) and couldn't bask in the love) where a number of examples of searching for services were started from Google queries of the form: "mapserver something".

So, a search for "[mapserver idaho](http://www.google.com/search?q=mapserver+idaho)" picks up [this ArcGIS service](http://maps.insideidaho.org/ArcGIS/rest/services/climatologyMeteorologyAtmosphere/precipitation/MapServer) pretty high up, a search for "[mapserver floods](http://www.google.com/search?q=mapserver+floods)" turns up [this ArcGIS flood service](http://gis.adaweb.net/ArcGIS/rest/services/CountyMapper/flood/MapServer), and so on.

This seems like bad news for the Google Karma of [Mapserver Classic](http://mapserver.org/), and also bad news from a customer conversation point-of-view. "We're standing up [a] Mapserver" now has a couple of pretty distinct meanings.
