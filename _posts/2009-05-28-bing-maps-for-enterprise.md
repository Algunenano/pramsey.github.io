I never thought I would feel sorry for the Beast from Redmond, but they seen to be regularly plumbing new lows. Microsoft Bob, you have a new rival for Worst Marketing Brainwave Ever, and his name is [Bing](http://d7.allthingsd.com/20090528/microsoft-bing-the-full-press-release/).

(And now I have to change all my presentation slides to refer to "Bing Maps for the Enterprise"? Flibbitty Jibbets for the Enterprise? Google at least managed to turn their silly name into a verb before plastering it everywhere in sight. Bing?!?)
