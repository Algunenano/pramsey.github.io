A WMS performance benchmark has been a staple of [FOSS4G](http://2009.foss4g.org) conferences for some time. In 2005, it was [IMS vs Mapserver](http://www.refractions.net/expertise/whitepapers/mapserver-arcims/mapserver-vs-arcims.pdf). In 2007 it was [MapServer vs Geoserver](http://2007.foss4g.org/presentations/view.php?abstract_id=120). And in 2008, a grudge [MapServer vs Geoserver re-match](http://blog.geoserver.org/2008/10/22/geoserver-benchmarks-at-foss4g-2008/).

For [2009](http://2009.foss4g.org), we hope to continue the MapServer vs Geoserver tradition, and are inviting other WMS servers to join the fray. We are hoping to have ArcGIS Server in the mix, perhaps MapGuide, perhaps DeeGree.  The participants are assembling on a [benchmarking listserv](http://lists.osgeo.org/mailman/listinfo/benchmarking).

However, right now we are stuck trying to find a location for our gunfight &ndash; we need an OK Corral.  Our preferred corral would have the following characteristics:

<ul><li>One or more dual-core processors<li>4Gb of more of RAM<li>Centos or RHEL<li>Remote ssh access for participants<li>Root access or sudo for participants<li>Not virtualized</ul>

In addition, we will need a second server on the same network segment for generating load (would still need remote access, but would not need a beefy machine).  Due to the nature of the participants (global) and the timelines (several months) we would need sole use of the corral until the testing is complete in September.

If you have a corral you can donate for the shoot-out, let me know!

**Update:** We have received a generous offer from the [US Army Corps](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/benchmarking/2009-June/000029.html).
