For a while there, Microsoft made a **lot** of hay about the London Stock Exchange using Windows in their trading system.

As it turns out, too much hay. The LSE [is now going to abandon their Windows trading system](http://blogs.computerworld.com/london_stock_exchange_to_abandon_failed_windows_platform). As the author points out, IT failures aren't all that rare, what is rare is learning about them. Usually the principals bury the body and move on to "Phase II". In this case the [principal was fired](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2009/feb/13/clara-furse-london-stock-exchange), and her replacement is hanging out the dirty laundry.

Another thing that is rare is for a dominant vendor to shoulder any blame for these kinds of failures. The usual principle is that, if everyone is doing it, it can't possibly be stupid.

Did you buy an expensive web mapping server and then have to put it on a nightly re-boot cycle to avoid service degradation? Don't worry, everyone is doing it, it doesn't reflect badly on you.

Is all your e-mail locked in [binary file archives](http://www.pcworld.com/article/130734/retrieval_tips_for_lost_white_house_emails.html), where a small corruption can render the entire archive irretrievable? Don't worry, everyone is doing it, it doesn't reflect badly on you.

It's not an IT thing, really, it's called "culture", our common shared beliefs and idiosyncrasies.

Don't worry, everyone is doing it, it doesn't reflect badly on you.
