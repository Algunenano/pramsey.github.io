<img src="http://www.urisab.org/logo.gif" style="float:right;padding:5px;"/>Tomorrow [Steven Citron-Pousty](http://thesteve0.wordpress.com/) and I will be [teaching a workshop](http://geowebconference.org/registration/workshops-monday/) on building a geostack using open source components: PostGIS, GeoServer, OpenLayers, QGIS, GeoWebCache! After that, I will be around all week taking in the interesting geoparty that is [GeoWeb](http://geoweb.org). Last year was my first GeoWeb, and while I found the talks a bit dry (perhaps I am not ready for the brave new world of building modeling), I found the calibre of the attendees bracing &ndash; it was a great place to meet movers and shakers in the (corporate) geoworld. "[Where 2.0 for grown-ups](http://www.galdosinc.com/archives/656)" indeed (for varying definitions of the term "grown-up").

**Update:** The workshop is [available online](http://workshops.opengeo.org/stack-intro/) now, for your self-guided learning pleasure.
