Being a colossal Apple fanboi now, immediately upon returning home from vacation I ordered the latest version of OS/X, "Snow Leopard" and promptly installed it on both my laptop and workstation. Without testing on one first. Whoops.

It looks like the new version of XCode is producing output that can't link to libraries compiled with the old version, so this morning I'm re-compiling everything I ever installed from code on both machines.

On the bright side, the performance claims seem to be bearing out. Apps are starting faster and boot-up in general is quicker.
