If you've been putting off registering for [FOSS4G](http://2009.foss4g.org) and are planning to attend the [PostGIS workshop](http://2009.foss4g.org/workshops/#workshop_03), better delay no longer &ndash; a little birdy tells me that the workshops program in general and PostGIS in particular are almost full.
