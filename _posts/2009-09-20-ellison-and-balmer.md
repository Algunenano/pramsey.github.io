If you haven't had a gander at [these videos at All Points Blog](http://apb.directionsmag.com/archives/6475-Larry-Ellison-Steve-Ballmer-on-Cloud-Computing.html) showing Larry Ellison (Oracle) and Steve Balmer (Microsoft) opining on the "cloud" take five minutes and have a look. Larry's still at [stage one](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KÃ¼bler-Ross_model) but Steve appears to have moved on to stage two.
