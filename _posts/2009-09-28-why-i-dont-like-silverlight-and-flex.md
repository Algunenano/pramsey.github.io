It's this guy. Whenever I go to some "new supercool, rich web thing" I am immediately greeted with this guy.

We spend all this effort to tune web sites, to [make them faster](http://oreilly.com/catalog/9780596522315), to get those page load times down down down, why do we do that? Because that's the optimum web experience &ndash; your click is my command! So every time I get dumped into one of these Silverlight/Flex things, and the loading bar is creeping along, my visceral response, usually around 68% is, "man, this is taking way too long, I'm going to go do something else". 

It's not fair, but it's true.
