If you haven't read Paul Bissett's take on the Goog's entrance into the data collection and LBS businesses, you must, he's nailing it. Start with "[GOOG = BORG, and I Mean That in the Nicest Way](http://blogs.weogeo.com/pbissett/2009/10/14/goog-borg-and-i-mean-that-in-the-nicest-way/)", and then do "[Google Will Open Source National Parcel Map](http://blogs.weogeo.com/pbissett/2009/10/29/google-will-open-source-national-parcel-map/)".
