A quiet bit of byplay is going on in the world of extreme geogeekery, as the [State of the Map](http://www.stateofthemap.org/) conference, the annual gathering of the OpenStreetMap community, decides where to host their 2010 event. The twist for this year is that an intrepid member of their spanish community has [suggested](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/foss4g2010/2009-October/000067.html) hosting the event in Barcelona, to align with the [FOSS4G 2010](http://2010.foss4g.org) event (either right before or right after). The OSM community decides on their site [in early December](http://www.opengeodata.org/2009/11/11/state-of-the-map-2010/) &ndash; I'll add my non-binding "ooooooooh, I hopehopehopehopehope they choose Barcelona!"
