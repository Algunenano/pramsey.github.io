I typed "postgis" into Google this evening, and in addition to the exquisitely organized first entry there were two ads, one relevant (EnterpriseDB, the Postgres company) and one **seemingly** utterly random, for an English language school.

Has the Google algorithm made a mistake? How is this relevant? Well, the language school **is** in Victoria, BC, birth-place of PostGIS, but it gets better than that.

Here's a picture of their sign, which I walked past every morning for almost five years, since the school shares a building (1207 Douglas Street) with Refractions Research, birth-company of PostGIS.

But wait, there's more! The name of the school is "GEOS Language Academy", and the [GEOS](http://trac.osgeo.org/geos) spatial library was also created in Victoria, specifically to bring spatial predicate algorithms to PostGIS!

Poor Google algorithm, you never stood a chance.
