How does your family mark Jobsmas Eve? Do you sing 1,2,3,4 and dance around your AirPort Extreme router, like my family? Or do you have a more relaxed, modern Jobsmas Eve, and just play networked iPod games together?

While, obviously, I am excited about the approach of Jobsmas, I find the hand-wringing and obsession about the physical shape of the Gift to be a bit over the top.

No matter what, it's going to be a glass slab about the size of a hard cover book, OK? Does it really matter if the back is silver or black? What gets my Jobsmas noodles in a knot is ... what is it going to **do**??? 

It's all about the software, how is this Gift different from the Gifts that have come before? Will the the new feature be something pointless and pretty like "Cover Flow", or something useful and immediately intuitive like "flick to scroll"? Pointless and pretty would be [virtual 3D display](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd3-eiid-Uw) via head tracking.  Useful and intuitive would be [pen-less handwriting](http://www.macrumors.com/2010/01/12/islate-input-alternatives-handwriting-recognition-without-a-stylus-and-much-more/).

No matter what, I am looking forward to getting up tomorrow, putting on my black turtleneck and black jeans, and celebrating true spirit of Jobsmas, by oggling the Gift and figuring out how it Changes Everything.
