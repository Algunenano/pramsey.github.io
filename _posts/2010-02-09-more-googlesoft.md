<img src="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.03/images/FF_118_google_4.jpg" style="float:right; padding:6px;" alt="Googlesoft" />More great news from the G-Men and G-Girls down in Mountain View &ndash; social networking goodness is now available from Google, in the form of [Google Buzz](http://www.google.com/buzz).

Since their first attempt at a standalone social network, [Orkut](http://www.orkut.com/), never achieved escape velocity (*exceto no Brasil!*), Google is trying again. Only this time, they are stealing a page from Microsoft and using an existing dominant franchise to force their new offering into the marketplace. Oh, and incidentally crush the incumbents.

The [CNET coverage](http://news.cnet.com/8301-30684_3-10449662-265.html) has this perfect sentence:

*Google is attempting to do this [compete with Facebook] by taking Gmail, one of its more popular products, and integrating Buzz directly into the Gmail interface.*

I mean, the parallel construction just writes itself! 

*Microsoft is attempting to do this [compete with Netscape] by taking Windows, one of its more popular products, and integrating Internet Explorer directly into the Windows interface.*

But Google's not content to just crush a strong competitor by leveraging their market-leading franchise! Remember, these are the smartest people in technology! Today they **also** announced they'll be crushing a few puny start-ups.  [Fourquare](http://foursquare.com/) and [Gowalla](http://gowalla.com), with all of 200,000 subscribers between them (divide that number into their $20M in combined venture money for a laugh) will henceforth be known as "that thing I tried before [Google Buzz for mobile](http://www.google.com/intl/en/mobile/buzz/) came along".

<small>(Incidentally, I'm looking forward to the day I receive my last Foursquare-initiated tweet, that charming idea got old incredibly fast. ***I don't care if you're at the 7-11!***)</small>

Keep on sucking up all the oxygen in the room G-People, yours is the fire that purifies, that consumes us down to the ashes of our soul and monetizes the dust left behind.
