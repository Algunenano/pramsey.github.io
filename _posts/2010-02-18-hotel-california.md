I recently bought a set of wireless handsets that include a digital answering machine, so I figured I should be economical and cancel my voicemail. This is the internet age, so I pay my bills and manage my phone account online. Go to my account page, a little hunting, and there's all the options available for voice mail.

Note that the check mark next to voicemail service is grayed out! You can **add** services via the web interface, but you can't remove them! I'd switch to the other phone company, but there isn't one. All I've got is the cable company, and they recently shut off my internet for a week, which put somewhat of a crimp in my working-from-home (became working-from-cafe).
