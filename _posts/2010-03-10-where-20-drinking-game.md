It's that time of year again, and I'll be sitting in the audience with my flask (I hope you will too!) playing the Where 2.0 drinking game. Here's some of my phrases, what are yours?

* ... find a Starbucks...
* ... we're releasing an API ...
* ... friends list ...

Also, take a big slug if someone talks about working with geospatial data more complex than a lat/lon point!
