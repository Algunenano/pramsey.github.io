[<img src="http://www.postgresonline.com/images/foss4g2010_small.png" style="float:right; padding:3px;border:0;"/>](http://2010.foss4g.org/)The presentation abstract deadline has passed for [FOSS4G 2010](http://2010.foss4g.org/) and there have been [354](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/foss4g2010/2010-April/000394.html) abstracts submitted! I'm not sure the exact number of session slots in the planned program, but for comparison 2007 had 120 slots and subsequent events have been similar -- that's about how many 30 minute talks you can fit into two days in a five-track format. In 2007, the biggest FOSS4G so far, we had around 240 submissions for our 120 slots. So, with three submissions for every slot, 2010 is looking like it is going to be gangbusters! Everyone wants to go to Barcelona, I guess they heard about the *escudella i carn dâ€™olla*.
