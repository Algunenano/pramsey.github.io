Last month I had an opportunity to give a 5-minute "[Ignite](http://ignite.oreilly.com/)" talk at [Where 2.0](http://en.oreilly.com/where2010) in San Jose. I chose my topic because I fear one of the things missing in the technologist enthusiasm for geolocation, particularly in the population of technically astute but non-geo people, is a respect for how locations are actually derived, and knowledge of the provenance of the data that undergirds our new mapping tools.
