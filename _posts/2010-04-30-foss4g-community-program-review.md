[<img src="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/thumb/d/d6/Foss4g2010_logo.jpg/180px-Foss4g2010_logo.jpg" align="right"/>](http://2010.foss4g.org/)It's that time of year again!  The [Community Program Review](http://2010.foss4g.org/review/) for [FOSS4G](http://2010.foss4g.org/) has begun!

If you're going to FOSS4G, or seriously thinking about going, the review is a way to ensure that the program includes topics you are interested in. You scroll through a list of all the abstracts the conference has received, and select the ones that are of interest to you. The conference committee tabulates all the results and uses that data to help build the program and to slot talks into rooms of appropriate size.

The number of abstracts is a good deal larger than the number of slots this year, so taking the time to do the review is a good idea if you're planning to attend this year!
