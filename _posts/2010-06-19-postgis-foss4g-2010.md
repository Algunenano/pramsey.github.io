One of the things that tickled me about the presentations selected for FOSS4G 2010 was the number of talks in the list that specifically mention PostGIS:

* Beyond PostGIS - New developments in Open Source Spatial Databases
* Introducing PostGIS WKT Raster: Seamless raster/vector operations in a spatial database 
* Introduction of flood evacuation route search system?using QGIS,PostGIS,GRASS and PgRouting
* Moving from Oracle/ArcGIS to PostGresql/PostGIS 
* PostGIS meets the third dimension 
* PostGIS WKT Raster. An Open Source alternative to Oracle GeoRaster
* Running long and complex processes with PostGIS 
* The State of PostGIS
* Tips for the PostGIS Power User

The last two are mine! And one is about not using PostGIS. But still, some interesting talks on the use and future of my favourite spatial database.
