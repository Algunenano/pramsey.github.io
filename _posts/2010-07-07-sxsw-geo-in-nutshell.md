From [Mapping and Geolocation: Turnkey Approaches You Need to Know](http://my.sxsw.com/events/event/7429) [[MP3](http://audio.sxsw.com/2010/podcasts/031610i_MappingandGeolocation.mp3)] at 19:55.

<blockquote>I think that, at least for us here [at SXSW] this week, Foursquare and Gowalla have been at the center of the universe for a little while.

And I think that [is because] it is something to do with the fact that it's been a problem we've been trying to solve forever. You know you've been thinking "wouldn't it be great if I knew where my friends are so I could find them and we could hang out more" for years and so now this is finally here.

So not only is it an easy way to do something, and solves a problem that we we've been trying to fix forever, it's the first time that location is kind of useful beyond maps. Everyone understands that you need location in maps, because you have to get from point A to point B â€¦ I want to know where I am so I can broadcast it, because it's cool that I go to cool conferences (um, isn't it?), and I want my friends to know where I am, and I want to be able to find where they are.</blockquote>

I'm over the hill and I'm not even 40. Now get the hell off my lawn!
