I had cable guys in my house turning on basic cable, and they noticed that my cable modem was old. When I say "old", I mean "I think I got it when we moved into the house almost 10 years ago". So they said, "here, have a new one". My maximum download speed quadrupled overnight. If you've got an old cable modem, figure an excuse to get a new one.
