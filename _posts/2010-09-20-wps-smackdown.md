<img src="http://www.prettytough.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/wps_logo.jpg" style="width:175px;float:right;"/>I was a little surprised last week when Jody Garnett told me that the most contentious session of FOSS4G turned out to be the ["WPS compliance testing"](http://2010.foss4g.org/presentations_show.php?id=3604) talk. Really? "Really", Jody insisted, "Voices were raised."

Over web processing service (WPS) compliance? Well, we are all knee-jerk nerds, so I guess I shouldn't be surprised. The results were presented by just one WPS project, the 52North one, but tested a broad swathe of them. I think the lesson to be learned is that you should be careful testing other people's software, and even more careful when brandishing the results of those tests.

The [WMS benchmarking exercise](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Benchmarking_2010), where each team runs their own service, seems like a better model, though demonstrably hard to coordinate in its own right.

The ZooWPS team has now [published their response](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/discuss/2010-September/007974.html), so if you are interested in WPS, here's a chance to dig deep into XML response payloads. Yum.
