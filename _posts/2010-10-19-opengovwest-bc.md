<img src="http://opengovwest.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/OGWBC-300x175.png" style="float:right;"/>There's an open government conference coming up next month, on November 10 at the University of Victoria: [OpenGovWest BC](http://opengovwest.org/open-gov-bc/)! We are gathering some great local stories, from Vancouver and the Provincial and Federal governments, and a great group of attendees &mdash; the kinds of folks looking to change the way government works. If you're in the area and want to join in, I encourage you to  [register](http://ogwbc.eventbrite.com/?ref=ecount) soon, the fee is nominal and the venue will fill up fast.
