I am going to feel the lack of a camera on this trip. I didn't even bother to bring my phone because it would have been a functionless brick.

<ol><li>**Techno toilet seats.** The one in the hotel had an explanation printed on it about why it was *not* heated. Nonetheless it still had three knobs. There is much more to learn about Japanese toilet seats. Looking forward to it.</li><li>**Defogged mirror.** I took a hot shower, got out, and there was a neat square of unfogged mirror area right over the sink! Touch it, yes, it's warmed from behind to keep the class clear of condensation.</li><li>**Hotel kimono.** I don't feel like getting dressed yes, and I don't feel like sitting around writing blog posts in the nude. Enter the hotel kimono! It's a little short for me, but that's OK.</li><li>**Taxi seats with doilies.** Taxi this morning had pretty white lace doilies on the backs of the seats. Also a pristine white seat cover on the back. Curiously despite being lovingly cared for the car itself looked like it dated from 1989.</li></ol><br />
