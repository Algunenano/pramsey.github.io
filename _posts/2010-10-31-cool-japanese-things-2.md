* **Talks with lots of demos.** When you can't understand the words, nothing talks like demos! I learned about bits of HTML5 for rendering, orientation sensors, location awareness and drag-and-drop! 
* **Rice for breakfast.** Wrapped in a belt of seaweed to hold it together, a patty of rice about the size of a hockey puck is not that different from a breakfast roll. Should have gotten two.
* **Insane double decker freeways.** Running through a canyon of buildings, there's something very blade-runnerish about the multi-level freeways. How far away is the ground?

Only one not-cool thing, being away from home on Halowe'en. Family is gathered to have wine and snacks right about now and the kids are bouncing off the walls getting ready to head out. Wish I was there.
