<ol><li>**All you can eat/drink reception.** You have two and a half hours.... go!</li><li>**Fast trains.** Because faster is better. Really.</li><li>**Vending machine restaurants.** No wait staff, you purchase your order from a vending machine, which gives you tickets you hand to the cooks. Order up!</li><li>**Cheap food.** If not cheap, at least not expensive, dinner out at Osaka pub with slightly more sake than I could handle and full up on (over-the-moon tasty) snack/tapas plates for about $40.</li></ol><br />
