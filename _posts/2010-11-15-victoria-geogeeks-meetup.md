**Update:** Twelve people RSVP'ed so far for [this month's meet](http://www.meetup.com/Victoria-GeoGeeks/calendar/15458443/)!

If you live in Victoria, BC, and you love geotechnology, I hope you'll join the [monthly geogeekery meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Victoria-GeoGeeks/) we are starting. The first Thursday of every month, at the Sticky Wicket pub. Our first gathering will be December 2, see you there!
