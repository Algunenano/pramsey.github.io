British Columbia, my fair home, is in the midst of an odd period where both major parties are having leadership races. The race for my party of choice (the NDP) has just gotten started, and I believe that pitching in early for what you believe in is a way to have maximum effect. So I'm spending my spring working as much as possible for [John Horgan](http://www.horganforbc.ca). John's someone who reflects my belief nobody has all the right answers, and he's someone with the personal skills (that I envy) to both listen for the answers and bring folks together around a common direction. And he's fun to be around, which is a nice bonus.

Unfortunately for [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/), time doing campaign work takes from time spent on PostGIS 2.0, so unless another PSC member has an equal and opposite infusion of time to mine, things will slow down a bit for the next couple months. I'll still be going to the [Montreal code sprint](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Montreal_Code_Sprint_2011) though: some things are sacrosanct.
