Getting the re-tweeting rounds today, [an article on why business are moving to the cloud](http://www.itworld.com/cloud-computing/174967/business-users-abandoning-it-quicker-self-serve-cloud-apps). The answer? To avoid their own IT departments.

> Their top reasons for going around IT? The need to respond quickly to changes in the market, self-sufficiency of their IT-savvy workforce, and the easy availability of top-quality it services that can be bought without long implementation or testing (cloud and SAAs apps, primarily).

[Watch out](/2011/06/it-revolution.html), the natives are restless.

**Update:** Check out the comment thread in the [slashdot.org](http://slashdot.org/story/11/06/17/1312206/Why-Businesses-Move-To-the-Cloud-They-Hate-IT) posting of this article for the good, bad and ugly of IT reaction to being sidelined. Ranges from "stupid users" to some thoughtful comments on the nature of organizations.
