David Pogue has a little [mini-rant](http://pogue.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/16/excited-about-the-cloud-get-ready-for-capped-data-plans/) today on the use of "cloud" as a generic term to mean "internet" which I found fun, if only because it reminded me of the odd origins of the term.

<img style="cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 103px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QZtrc3_6QSI/Tf-aCD8kgpI/AAAAAAAAAEY/UJpGCxUs3Y0/s320/screenshot_01.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5620380220191441554" />

As far as I can guess, the term leaked out of white-board shorthand used by folks drawing up high-level architecture diagrams. Who it was who popularized that diagram convention is a mystery, probably it is an elaboration on some even earlier trope. Now, thanks to [Microsoft marketing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HRrbLA7rss), the term means... nothing? everything? kung fu music? computers-can-magically-solve-anything?
