I'm sure I'll have to spend a lot more time trolling the [DataBC](http://data.gov.bc.ca) site before I have discovered all the jewels therein amongst the dross, but one thing I noticed while searching for "[birth](http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/dbc/search/result.page?ms=url%3Aapps.gov.bc.ca&keyword=birth)" was a large number of entries like [this entry from Vital Statistics](http://www.data.gov.bc.ca/dbc/search/detail.page?recorduid=171751): "Table 25 - Infant Mortality by Gestational Age and Birth Weight, British Columbia, 2005"

Is this data? Kinda. There's numbers. It's an Excel sheet. But let's get real here, this is a report. It's a summary. That's why Vital Statistics has hundreds and hundreds of "data set" entries like this in the catalogue instead of the number they should have: **ONE**. 

There is one database of births and deaths in the province. Strip out the names and addresses, leave the causes, dates, ages, postal codes, and release **THAT** please, instead of the hundreds of year-by-year (not even longitudinal summaries! arg!) summaries.
