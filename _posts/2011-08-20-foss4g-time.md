[<img src="http://wiki.osgeo.org/images/7/72/Foss4g_2011_150px.png" style="float:right; padding:5px;">](http://2011.foss4g.org)A journey of 1000 miles starts with one step, and if you're wondering whether open source is in your future, the first step should be a trip to [FOSS4G 2011](http://2011.foss4g.org/) in Denver this year. 
<br />
<br />My favorite local open source geospatial success story, [Pierce County](http://www.co.pierce.wa.us/pc/), in Washington, started four years ago, when the GIS manager sent a small contingent north to attend <a href="http://2007.foss4g.org"</a>FOSS4G 2007</a> in Victoria. From the knowledge and enthusiasm garnered there they have been able to start to re-make their infrastructure into a flexible mixed environment of open source and proprietary tools.
<br />
<br />But it all starts with the basic knowledge. What's out there? Who can build with it? What are the best choices? You'll never have a more concentrated opportunity to answer all your questions about open source geospatial than FOSS4G.
<br />
<br />I'll be there all week, teaching a [workshop on PostGIS](http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/introduction-postgis-sold-out) (sorry, sold out) and giving talks on [introductory PostGIS](http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/state-postgis) and [advanced PostGIS trickery](http://2011.foss4g.org/sessions/tips-postgis-power-user).
<br />
<br />See you all in Denver!
