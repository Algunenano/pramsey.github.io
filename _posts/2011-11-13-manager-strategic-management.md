Every week, LinkedIn kindly sends me a list of "jobs I might be interested in", which I have to say is an interesting feature, given the data they have to work with. Like the early days of Google advertising, it's fun to see what the algorithm comes up with as "relevant" to me. And this week I got this awesome, awesome, awesome, awesome entry: <br />

<blockquote>**Manager, Strategic Management**<br />The Manager, Strategic Management is accountable for leading the development, maintenance and evaluation of corporate planning, performance management, benchmarking, risk management, and reporting programs.  The position reports to the Chief Executive Officer of BC Assessment and works directly with the governing Board of Directors to facilitate strategic planning and risk management sessions. The position exercises considerable latitude and independence to oversee and develop a coordinated and consultative corporate plan, risk and performance management culture across BC Assessment. In this role, the position is expected to manage the corporate planning cycle to achieve a top to bottom linking of mandate and vision of operational business activities including the annual and year-over-year alignment of budgets, resource allocation, performance and risk management programs. This position leads a small team, including senior program analysts and a research officer. </blockquote>

People I trust tell me BC Assessment has so much money, they really **do** eat [$16 muffins](http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2011/09/great-16-dollar-muffin-myth) for breakfast, but the existence of the "Manager, Strategic Management" is all the proof I need.
