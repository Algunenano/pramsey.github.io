The Federal NDP is in a leadership race, which means that candidates who have paid their entrance fee have access to the membership list, some 100,000 Canadians like myself. As a political observer and data fiend, who had access to such a list myself [only this spring](/2011/01/we-interrupt-this-geeky-spring.html), I love watching to see how people make use of it: do we get the standard policy screed, the informative candidate-is-visiting message, or something more devious... like the below!  So, an email arrives stating: 

> Dear Member of NDP, 
>
> I would really appreciate your participation in a study we’re currently conducting amongst members of the federal NDP. 
>

The fact that they **have the NDP membership list**, and the content of the poll, lead me to believe it is associated with a leadership campaign in some way. But it's been done anonymously. The campaign that has done this both (a) gets the data and (b) pretty much ensures that anyone else trying the same gambit will get a much lower response rate. The poll itself is very long, I wonder how many full responses they get? I also wonder if there will be any blowback for using the list in this way? Based on the content of the poll, which campaign do you think is behind it? If the answer seems obvious, and you think there will be blowback, could the poll in fact be the product of a different campaign? Ain't politics grand?  

>**Update:** Just to leave no stone unturned, I asked the researcher who commissioned the study, but the answer is not illuminating: 

> The Logit Group is a Gold Seal Member Agency of the Marketing Research and Intelligence Associaton (MRIA), Canada's governing body for all market research firms.  As such, we conform to all regulations related to privacy and confidentiality. In this instance, the organization that provided us with member lists required that the survey be completed in a confidential, or "blind" method (whereby the survey sponsor was not identified at the outset).  In return, the responses of individual members (such as yourself) would not be attributed to you specifically when reported back (survey findings would only be provided in aggregate form).
