One of the nerdy highlights of my year is the always the annual North American code sprint (previously held in [Toronto (2009)](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Toronto_Code_Sprint_2009#Recaps), [New-York (2010)](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/New_York_Code_Sprint_2010#Recaps) and [Montreal (2011)](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Montreal_Code_Sprint_2011#Announcements.2C_News.2C_Recaps)). It started out as a MapServer, C-Tribe kind of thing, but has also had participants from the OpenLayers and GeoServer community too. Basically, if you have an open source geoproject and a team of more than one, the sprint is an excellent opportunity to get face time and serious progress under your belt.

This year, [the sprint is on Bainbridge Island](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/IslandWood_Code_Sprint_2012) near Seattle and the nature of the venue (all inclusive, room, board, meeting space) means pre-registration is de riguer. So if you're coming, please [register now](http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/IslandWood_Code_Sprint_2012#Registration.2C_Participant_Costs).
