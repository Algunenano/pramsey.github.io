For all those Americans, who think your political culture is uniquely corrupt or tarnished by money or special interests, I give you, direct from Canada, in all its astroturfing glory, "Ethical Oil".

<center>[http://www.ethicaloil.org/](http://www.ethicaloil.org/)</center>

My favorite part is the donation area, "Please consider making a $5, $10 or $15 donation..." because of course ethicaloil.org relies "on small donors like you to sustain our grassroots advocacy". They won't take money "from foreign corporations, foundations, governments, or lobbyists", so it's a good thing there's lots of money available from **CANADIAN** corporations, foundations and lobbyists.

I took the kids to school this morning after reading [this](http://pricetags.wordpress.com/2012/01/03/a-bad-case-of-scenarios/) and especially [this](http://www.grist.org/climate-change/2011-12-05-the-brutal-logic-of-climate-change) so my tolerance for people who think time-shifted mass murder is **ETHICAL** is a little lower than usual today.
