[FOSS4G North America](http://foss4g-na.org) is one month away! Due to venue restrictions (400 max!), we only have a limited number of registration spaces still remaining, so sign up soon!

<br /><ul><li>The full program is here, online at [http://foss4g-na.org/program/](http://foss4g-na.org/program/)<br /><li>Online registration is here, at [http://foss4g-na.org/registration/](http://foss4g-na.org/registration/)<br /><li>Rooms at nearby hotels are available too, in a limited room block, [http://foss4g-na.org/hotel-block-annouced/](http://foss4g-na.org/hotel-block-annouced/)</ul><br />We are proud of our program, which includes talks from open source developers, managers and visionaries. FOSS4G North America is a great opportunity to learn about the statue of the art, and how people are putting open source to use in their organizations.  We hope to see you in DC!<br />&nbsp;
