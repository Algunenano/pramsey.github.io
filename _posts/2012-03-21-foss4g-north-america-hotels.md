Finding hotels in DC can be a ... PITA? Stronger? Hell stroll? Death munch? Face grind? Anyways, our room block at the fabulous Marriott chain is at the reasonable-only-in-DC rate of $189, which is even lower than the government rate. And the block is **going away**, [so if you haven't booked your room, do it now](http://foss4g-na.org/accommodations)!
