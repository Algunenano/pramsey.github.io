<p>Turns out not only am I not insane, I'm not on the bleeding edge or even remotely innovative!  

When I say that enterprise IT projects should be broken into small parts, done by independent small teams, and manage risk by managing size, I'm actually parroting the United States Office of Management and Budget, the boringest, stodgiest organization on the planet! 

[Modular system development mitigates risk](http://www.fiercegovernmentit.com/story/modular-system-development-mitigates-risk-says-werfel/2013-02-14), says Daniel Werfel, federal controller for the OMB.</p>

<blockquote>Under modular development, discrete project deliverables get pushed out more often, meaning that reviews and evaluations happen sooner, allowing for the possibility for quick corrective actions that can mitigate financial exposure.</blockquote>

<p>And...</p>

<blockquote>Projects of a more traditional variety--in which about 80 percent of the budget goes to customizing a commercial solution--cannot quickly adapt to changing laws or technology and often have costs rise by hundreds of millions of dollars.</blockquote>

<p>Check out this awesome graphic from the guidance document:

Read the [full guidance document](http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/procurement/guidance/modular-approaches-for-information-technology.pdf) if you dare: they didn't get to be the boringest, stodgiest organization on the planet by bringing their "B" game.</p>
