Apropos of nothing, here's every RFP document issued for the ICM project in BC (and there were 10 different RPF/ITQ/RFI/NOI postings over the years) rendered as a word cloud.  <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KlIaSEnsZQg/USk5goG69cI/AAAAAAAAABU/HQAkw1-zK4M/s1600/screenshot_01.png" imageanchor="1" ><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KlIaSEnsZQg/USk5goG69cI/AAAAAAAAABU/HQAkw1-zK4M/s320/screenshot_01.png" width="520" /></a> Notice the prominence of "child" and "family".  When you get down to brass tacks, enterprise IT doesn't much care about *what you do*, but it very intensely cares about *how you do it*.
