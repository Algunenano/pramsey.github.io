What could possibly go wrong?

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">[<img border="0" height="428" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_qexd9MfMFM/UctbRrlxj3I/AAAAAAAAAC4/4keAPhcNiRM/s640/screenshot_01.png" width="640" />](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_qexd9MfMFM/UctbRrlxj3I/AAAAAAAAAC4/4keAPhcNiRM/s1600/screenshot_01.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;)</div><br />Bringing the [unalloyed success that is ICM](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2012/06/more-icm.html)&nbsp;to the rest of government is a no brainer! (Does that mean you need no brain to recommend it, or no brain to accept the recommendation? What an odd phrase.) The [strategic plan for the BC natural resource sector](http://docs.openinfo.gov.bc.ca/D8188512A_Response_Package_MOE-2011-00242.PDF) includes a case (authored by whom, I wonder) for "re-using" the ICM technology in natural resource permitting.

The business case will go to Treasury Board some time this year, and we'll soon be off to the races, with a huge capital allocation for systems development that can only be bid by a major multi-national. Thanks to [cabinet secrecy](http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20F%20--/Freedom%20of%20Information%20and%20Protection%20of%20Privacy%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%20165/00_Act/96165_02.xml#section12) and [third party commercial](http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/LOC/freeside/--%20F%20--/Freedom%20of%20Information%20and%20Protection%20of%20Privacy%20Act%20RSBC%201996%20c.%20165/00_Act/96165_02.xml#section21) exemptions to the BC FOI law, the taxpayers footing the bill for this extravaganza will get to see neither the full business case, nor the winning bid, nor the billing schedules of the winning bidder.

If we're lucky we'll get to see a redacted PowerPoint presentation given to Cabinet, which ironically enough will leave us just about as educated on the issues as the actual decision makers pulling the trigger on this new adventure. Ain't technology decision making grand?
