It's hard to believe a whole year has gone by! And yet, it has. July is here, the [BC 2012/2013 Public Accounts](http://www.fin.gov.bc.ca/ocg/pa/12_13/Pa12_13.htm) have come out, so it's time to update my tracking of IT outsourcing spending with another year's [data points](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsM7ePw4lyCDdFRjVVI4ZURtb2kyeFpPbVhqdmM2M3c&amp;usp=sharing)!

Last year the government's "private sector partners" notched up 8% year-over-year growth to extract **$393,603,233** from the treasury, setting another all-time record! While growth has slowed from last year's 21% pace, IT spending growth is still above both the rate of inflation and the overall growth rate of the budget. Suck on *that*, children and sick people!

In the individual category, **HP Advanced Solutions** continues to rule the roost, posting 19% growth to notch a league-leading $130M in billings. At this point, nobody else is even close. Former champ IBM continues to shed billings, and now lags even Maximus with only $59M in billings.

My favourite [systems integrator](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2013/07/natural-resource-sector-goes-over.html), Deloitte &amp; Touch, has plateaued at $36M in billings, but with potential new builds in natural resources to add to the social services sector, they could surprise on the upside next season: get your bets in early.

**Update:** I figured out what [last years mysterious entry for "Oracle Microsystems"](http://blog.cleverelephant.ca/2012/07/bc-it-outsourcing-update.html) is. Somehow, Sun Microsystems won [a big services contract](http://www.health.gov.bc.ca/ehealth/pdf/PLIS_project_summary.pdf) to build components of the eHealth systems (a pharmacy system and an electronic health record). So, the totals and growth rate numbers have been updated. And here I thought Sun was a hardware company (perhaps somebody knew somebody). Once Oracle bought Sun, we have a name change to "Oracle Microsystems", but still a healthy $20M annual services spend. And a new seam of IT boondogglery to investigate: eHealth must be the grand-daddy of them all.
