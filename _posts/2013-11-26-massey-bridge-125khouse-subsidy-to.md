<p>Last week I was driving home from the NDP convention with a semi-retired traffic engineer in the backseat (and he was not backseat driving) when we passed under the Fraser River via the Massey Tunney. 

<img src="http://www.cbc.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1862973.1379950804!/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_620/image.jpg" style="padding-left: 10px" align="right" width="250" />"This tunnel provides 3 lanes in the direction of peak flow during rush hour", he said, "and if they build the 8-lane Massey Bridge that will add one lane, which is 2000 cars per hour, which over a 3 hour rush hour is 6000 new commuters. Assuming half the new households they put in here have a commuter the new bridge will support the development of 12,000 new houses." 

Now, 12,000 new houses in south Delta/Ladner/Tsawassen will certainly eat up a lot of nice farm land, and that's a tragedy in its own right. But given that number of households, I immediately divided it into the $3B probable cost of a bridge-plus-Richmond-highway-expansion, and was **blown away**. 

Three billion dollars divided by twelve thousand homes is **$250,000 per home**. Be generous if you like, and assume a much lower number of Fraser crossing commuters in the new developments. It's still hard to get the number lower than $100,000 per new home. 

So, a review of the facts: </p><ul><li>Traffic in the current tunnel is [actually falling](http://pricetags.wordpress.com/2012/07/13/the-massey-tunnel-and-congestion-does-data-matter/).</li><li>So new development is the only reason to build an 8-lane monster bridge over the river.</li><li>The extra lanes on the bridge will increase capacity by [2,000 cars per hour](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane#Lane_width_and_capacity), which can be extrapolated to 12,000 to 24,000 new homes, depending on your assumptions.</li><li>The last major bridge/highway project cost 3 billion dollars, and [everyone seems to think](http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Vaughn+Palmer+full+speed+ahead+Operation+Massey+Bridge+Christy+Clark+project/9068824/story.html) building a new bridge and widening the freeway north of it will also cost "about" 3 billion dollars.</li><li>3 billion dollars divided by 24,000 homes is $125,000 per home.</li></ul><p>Which leads me to the inescapable conclusion that **BC taxpayers are going to be subsidizing "affordable" new housing south of the Fraser to the tune of about $125K per new home**.

Can someone stop the ride now? I'm feeling a bit queezy and I want to get off.</p>
