One morning this winter, while I was sipping my coffee at the cafe below our office, a well-dressed man and woman sat down at the table next to me, and started talking. Turns out, they were my favourite kind of people &mdash; IT people! They were going to bid on the [Integrated Decision Making](/2013/07/natural-resource-sector-goes-over.html) project, and were talking about my favourite systems integrator, [Deloitte](http://www.deloitte.com). 

"Is Deloitte trying to bring [ICM](/2012/06/more-icm.html) and [Siebel](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/siebel/overview/index.html) into this project?" she asked.<br/>"No, not anymore" he replied "now they are really pushing [SalesForce.com](https://www.salesforce.com)." 

Now this was interesting! Chastened by their [failure to shoehorn social services case management](/2012/06/more-icm.html) into a [CRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management), Deloitte has adroitly pivoted and is trying to shoehorn natural resource permitting into ... a [cloud CRM](https://www.salesforce.com).

(I should parenthetically point out that, unsurprisingly, the **SALES** people in our company find **SALES**force.com very useful in coordinating and tracking their **SALES** activities.) 

Certainly pushing a platform that is actually growing in usage makes more sense than pushing [one](http://www.oracle.com/us/products/applications/siebel/overview/index.html) that end-of-lifed a decade ago, but still, again with the CRM?

Deloitte isn't being coy with their plans, they are selling them to the highest levels of the government. On [October 7](http://s3.cleverelephant.ca.s3.amazonaws.com/CIO-2013-10-07.pdf), 2013, the BC CIO spent two and a half hours enjoying the hospitality of Deloitte and Salesforce.com at a "BC government executive luncheon" on the topic "Innovation, Transformation and Cloud Computing in the Public Sector‚Äù.

And there's another wrinkle. SF.com is a US-based cloud service provider, and our Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIPPA) says that personal data [must be stored in Canada](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/LOC/complete/statreg/--%20F%20--/Freedom%20of%20Information%20and%20Protection%20of%20Privacy%20Act%20[RSBC%201996]%20c.%20165/00_Act/96165_03.xml#section30.1). SF.com is also a US legal entity, which means they are subject to the [PATRIOT Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patriot_Act) which allows authorities to access personal data without notifying the subject of the search. That is also [not allowed](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/LOC/complete/statreg/--%20F%20--/Freedom%20of%20Information%20and%20Protection%20of%20Privacy%20Act%20[RSBC%201996]%20c.%20165/00_Act/96165_03.xml#section30.2) by BC's FOIPPA. 

What is an ambitious system integrator with a hammer suitable for every nail to do? Not change hammers! That would be silly. Far better to try and get an exemption or figure out a workaround. Workarounds add nice juicy extra complexity to the hammer, which can only help billable hours.

More on the workaround, [tomorrow](/2014/07/tokenization-and-your-private-data-2.html).
