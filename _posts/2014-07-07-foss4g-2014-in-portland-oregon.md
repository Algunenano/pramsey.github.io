Just a quick public service announcement for blog followers in the Pacific Northwest and environs: you've got a once in a not-quite-lifetime opportunity to attend the "[Free and Open Source Software for Geospatial](http://2014.foss4g.org)" (aka FOSS4G) conference this year in nearby Portland, Oregon, a city so hip they have trouble seeing over their pelvis.

Anyone in the GIS / mapping world should take the opportunity to go, to learn about what technology the open source world has available for you, to meet the folks writing the software, and the learn from other folks like you who are building cool things.

**September 8th-13th**, be there and be square.
