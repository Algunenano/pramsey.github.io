The BC Liberal government is changing the Elections Act to allow **unlimited party and candidate spending within one month of election day** and meanwhile, as usual, the media are transfixed by the shiny object in the corner.

The political pundits are making a great deal of noise (see V. Palmer's [inside baseball assessment](http://www.vancouversun.com/news/Vaughn+Palmer+Ground+shifts+under+political+parties+voter+list/11002488/story.html) if you care) about an amendment to the Elections Act that says that:

> "the chief electoral officer must provide &hellip; to a registered political party, in respect of a general election &hellip; a list of voters that indicates which voters on the list voted in the general election"

At the same time, they are **ignoring** the BC Liberals fundamentally changing the money dynamic of the fixed election date by **eliminating the 60-day "pre-campaign" period**.

> "Section 198 is amended (a) by repealing subsections (1) and (2) and substituting the following: (1) In respect of a general election, the total value of election expenses incurred by a registered political party during the campaign period must not exceed $4.4 million."

The Elections Act currently divides up the election period before a fixed election into two "halves": the 60 days before the official campaign, and the campaign period itself (about 28 days if I recall correctly). In the first 60 days, candidates can spend a maximum of $70,000 and parties a maximum of $1.1 million. In the campaign period, candidates can spend another $70,000 and parties as much as $4.4 million.

The intent of the "pre-campaign" period is clearly to focus campaigning on the campaign period itself, by limiting the amount of early spending by parties. The "money density" of the pre-campaign period is about $18,000 / day in party spending; in the campaign period, it is almost $160,000 / day.

This is all very public-spirited, and contributes to a nice focussed election period. But (**BUT!**) the BC Liberals currently have [more money than they know what to do with](http://www.theprovince.com/business/Liberal+Party+raised+million+2014+official+records+show/10955807/story.html), so it is in their interest to be able to focus all that money as close to the event as possible. And rather than simply raising the pre-campaign spending limit they went one better: they removed it all together. They can spend **unlimited amounts of money** as close as 28 days before election day, 21 days before the opening of advance polls. 

Let me repeat that: they can spend **unlimited amounts of money**.

So in British Columbia now, it is legal to both **raise** unlimited amounts of money from corporations, unions and individuals in any amounts at all (and some individuals and corporations have donated to the BC Liberals, individually, over $100,000 a year), and it is legal to **spend** unlimited amounts of money, right up to within 28 days of the election day.

See any problems with that?
