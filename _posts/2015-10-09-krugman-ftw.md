> "Sometimes I have the impression that many people in the media consider it uncouth to acknowledge, even to themselves, the fraudulence of much political posturing. The done thing, it seems, is to pretend that we’re having real debates about national security or economics even when it’s both obvious and easy to show that nothing of the kind is actually taking place."<br/>&mdash; [Paul Krugman](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/opinion/its-all-benghazi.html)
