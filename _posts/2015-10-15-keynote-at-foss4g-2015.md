On my usual bi-annual schedule, I gave a keynote talk at [FOSS4G this year in Seoul](http://2015.foss4g.org), about the parallel pressures on open source that the move to cloud computing is providing. On the one hand, the cloud runs on open source. On the other hand, below the API layer the cloud is pretty much the opposite of open: it's as much a black box as the old Win32 API. And the growth of cloud is paralleled by the shrinkage of infrastructure maintainers in other venues; the kinds of folks who currently use and produce OSS. It's a big change coming down the highway.
