I attended PgConf Silicon Valley a couple weeks ago and gave a new talk about aspects of PostGIS that come as a surprise to new users. Folks in Silicon Valley arrive at PostGIS with lots of technical chops, but often little experience with geospatial concepts, which can lead to fun misunderstandings. Also, PostGIS just has a lot of historical behaviours we've kept in place for backwards compatibility over the years.

Thanks to everyone who turned out to attend!
