This week I had the pleasure of presenting the morning keynote at [Geomatiqué 2016](http://www.geomatique2016.com/) in Montreal. I've been thinking a lot recently about symbiosis of technology and culture: how new technology is generating new norms to go along with it. We humans are enormously adaptable, so princples that were sacrosanct to one generation become unknown to the next, and back again.

On the chopping block for our generation: privacy. 

Not that privacy is any human absolute. I doubt a hunter gatherer had a lot of personal space and privacy: the smaller the group, the more fevered the gossip-mill. On the other hand, the abolition of privacy within the context of an industrial-sized polity will truly be something new under the sun. It could be fine, in its way; it could also be [Nineteen Eighty-Four](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four) realized.

Anyways, the talk is mostly a survey of technology trends, with some philosophizing at the end. Unfortunately, no video at this event, but if you'd like me to deliver this talk to your organization, drop me a line.
