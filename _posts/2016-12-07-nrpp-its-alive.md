Hey, good news zombie lovers, the project I've declared [dead](/2016/11/nrpp-is-dead.html) (or, at least, [doomed](/2016/12/nrpp-still-doomed.html)) is not only still ambulatory, it's going to get the official political glad-handing treatment tomorrow:

> We are excited to share an important Natural Resource Permitting Project (NRPP) milestone. Tomorrow—December 7—NRPP’s first service on the NRS Online Services website will be launched in Williams Lake at FrontCounter BC with Minister of State for Rural Economic Development Donna Barnett. 

I always feel sad for the poor politician tasked with the "[new website](https://www.google.ca/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=%22new+website%22+site:gov.bc.ca+news)" announcement, because honestly, is there any announcement that feels like more of an empty gesture towards real action? "Yes, you wanted $50M for addiction treatment, but... how about this new web site?"

Anyways, while she's getting her demonstration of the new [NRS Online Services website](https://portal.nrs.gov.bc.ca/), here's some questions Minister Barnett might like to ask:

* Can I drive? Let me use the computer. Why don't you ever let the Minister use the computer? I'm the Minister, dammit.
* Why is it so slow? Surely for this kind of money it should be fast.

* What are all those buttons across the top? What does the pencil mean? I've never seen those icons before. What do you mean "have I ever used ArcView?", what's ArcView?

* You really expect me to click all those links to find out what impacts my project? There's got to 20 of them!

* Does it work on my phone? Ah, kind of, I see. No, I don't know what a "bootstrap" is.

* Honestly, why is it so slow? Am I clicking it wrong?

* Does this work align with government priorities? Maybe you need to work on it a little more?

Congratulations, NRPP
