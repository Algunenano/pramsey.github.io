For all the [electrons spilled](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/absentee-voting-explained-1.4108548) speculating on what trends might apply to the Courtenay-Comox absentee ballots being [counted next week](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-recounts-1.4114329), I feel like I haven't seen the actual numbers from 2013 in print anywhere, so here they are from the [2013 Statement of Votes](elections.bc.ca/docs/rpt/2013GE/2013-GE-SOV.pdf):

| Section                     | GP    | NDP   | CP   | LIB   | Total | %     |
|:----------------------------|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
| s. 98 Special               | 20    | 83    | 8    | 57    | 168   | 4.8%  |
| s. 99 Absentee - in ED      | 219   | 607   | 86   | 560   | 1472  | 42.0% |
| s. 100 Absentee - out of ED | 42    | 132   | 6    | 111   | 291   | 8.3%  |
| s. 101 Absentee - advance   | 8     | 41    | 3    | 41    | 92    | 2.7%  |
| s. 104 Voting in DEO office | 119   | 519   | 74   | 601   | 1313  | 37.5% |
| s. 106 Voting by mail       | 18    | 74    | 15   | 61    | 168   | 4.8%  |
| Total                       | 426   | 1456  | 192  | 1431  | 3505  | 100%  |
| %                           | 12.2% | 41.5% | 5.5% | 40.8% | 100%  | -     |

Some caveats: 

* Redistribution made the 2017 riding somewhat **weaker** for the NDP than it was in 2013. (Advantage: Liberals)
* In 2017 the NDP candidate did somewhat **better** than in 2013. (Advantage: NDP)
* In 2013 the NDP candidate lost the riding but (barely) won the absentee tally. (Advantage: NDP)

With those caveats in mind, the final conclusion: anyone who tells you that there's a predictable direction the absentee ballot will go based on past results is blowing smoke up your \*\*\*.
