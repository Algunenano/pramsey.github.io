Because I was asked.

Here's my 2017 FOSS4G list:

* [Why We Code](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbRbRSxw0c1Mt0), the opening keynote, delivered by me. The least I can do is show up.
* [Building the Capital Planning Platform: Leveraging Open Source Software to build data and mapping tools in Local Government](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbT1MC6G50gV60), because I like tales about open source navigating the pitfalls of the public sector IT world, and because the presenter was a co-worker with me at Carto who I enjoyed a great deal.
* [Protobuf based output formats for PostGIS](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbSfNVog3uWDXl), because these are new in PostGIS 2.4 and I haven't read the commits, might as well get some info straight from the horses mouth.
* [FOSS4G from the Trenches](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbU5IEx08JBLkr), because the belly of the GIS beast is the local government market, hearing how a practitioner has cracked that most uncrackable and conservative of audiences is very interesting.
* [End-to-End Geo Machine Learning](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbSJOpX62oLvzZ), because buzzwords! And because I, for one, welcome our new AI overlords.
* [A Journey through R for Geo](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbVrBeMuDo0lW7), because R and statistics are "AI for the rest of us", and I don't know enough (anything) about spatial statistics.
* [Best Practice for Serving Imagery using MapServer on Amazon Web Services](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbWv7hDeH6VcB3), because S3/AWS is an under-appreciated solution for the "hosting a bunch of files as a tile service" problem, and the AWS solution gets better every year.
* [Two laptops and a bag of thumb drives: knitting together a global community using FOSS4G](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbXH6NVEICftjE), because I've gotten too far away from the on-the-ground aspect of how real users approach FOSS4G software. Too much time with the coder set gives one a skewed outlook.
* [Trillions of points - spatial indexing, organization, and exploitation of massive point clouds](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbWv7hDeH6VcAs), because I know [pgpointcloud](http://github.com/pgpointcloud) isn't the answer, and I think something like this is.
* [Accelerating geospatial analytics using Apache Spark](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbVVCy5KChqTxp), because buzzwords! And someone is promising to do actual joins in a big data tool; bring it on!
* [Free Software: Freedom, Privacy, Sovereignty](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbV9EHnkBbgCPa), because Stallman.
* [Processing Imagery from the Worldâ€™s Largest Private Fleet of Satellites](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbZkx9UIPtpsax), because the Planet image processing chain is a wonder of the world, and I want to know more, more, more.
* [CARTO's spatial analytics extension, an update](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVba6vplsR00A9D), because embarrassingly I don't know much about the non-PostGIS analytics we expose in CARTO, and I want to hear Andy talk.
* [Big Weather Data, all about partitions and precipitation](http://foss4g.guide/#9M4SVbYL2QLyLVAkO3), because weather was doing "big data" before it was a buzzword, using nothing but perl and cunning, I want to see what they are up to know.
* [Metric Geometry and Gerrymandering](http://foss4g.guide/#9N2LkG7vwJhi0ywAcs), because even though the answer to gerry-mandering is [electoral reform, not redistricting](http://www.sightline.org/2017/08/02/slaying-the-gerrymander-part-1-how-to-attack-the-beast/), I retain an interest in how the "redistricting can be fixed" folks are attacking the impossible problem.

One week and I'll be in Boston, looking forward to it!
