**TL;DR:** There are some changes in PostgresSQL 12 that FDW authors might be surprised by! Super technical, not suitable for ordinary humans.

OK, so I decided to update my two favourite extension projects ([pgsql-http](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http) and [pgsql-ogr-fdw](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-ogr-fdw)) yesterday to support PostgreSQL 12 (which is the version currently under development likely to be released in the fall).

Fixing up [pgsql-http](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-http) was pretty easy, involving just one internal function signature change.

Fixing up [pgsql-ogr-fdw](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-ogr-fdw) involved some time in the debugger wondering what had changed.

### Your Slot is Empty

When processing an FDW insert/update/delete, [your code](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-ogr-fdw/blob/93585b635a5659baaf47ab11b20c6e45c1b45b45/ogr_fdw.c#L2388-L2391) is expected to take a `TupleTableSlot` as input and use the data in that slot to apply the insert/update/delete operation to your backend data store, whatever that may be (OGR in my case). The data lived in the `tts_values` array, and the null flags in `tts_isnull`.

In PostgreSQL 12, the slot arrives at your `ExecInsert/ExecUpdate/ExecDelete` callback function empty! The `tts_values` array is populated with `Datum` values of 0, yet the `tts_isnull` array is full of `true` values. There's no data to pass back to the FDW source.

What gives?!?

[Andres Freund](https://github.com/anarazel) has been slowly laying the groundwork for [pluggable storage](https://www.postgresql.eu/events/pgconfeu2018/schedule/session/2207-pluggable-storage-in-postgresql/) in PostgreSQL, and [one of the things that work has affected](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/commit/4da597edf1bae0cf0453b5ed6fc4347b6334dfe1) is `TupleTableSlot`. Now when you get a slot, it might not have been fully populated yet, and that is what is happening in the FDW code.

The short-term fix is just to force the slot to populate by calling [slot_getallattrs](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/5408e233f0667478e7f2a3e4b914e14217e20729/src/include/executor/tuptable.h#L348-L352), and then go on with your usual work. That's [what I did](https://github.com/pramsey/pgsql-ogr-fdw/blob/93585b635a5659baaf47ab11b20c6e45c1b45b45/ogr_fdw.c#L2402-L2410). A more future-proof way would be to use [slot_getattr](https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/7c366ac969ce060c4080fbdfe74a0131ae4bf6bb/src/include/executor/tuptable.h#L379-L381) and only retrieve the attributes you need (assuming you don't just need them all).

### Your VarLena might have a Short Header

Varlena types are the variable size types, like `text`, `bytea`, and `varchar`. Varlena types store their length and some extra information in a header. The header is potentially either 4 bytes or 1 byte long. Practically it is almost always a 4 byte header. If you call the standard `VARSIZE` and `VARDATA` macros on a varlena, the macros assume a 4 byte header.

The assumption has always held (for me), but not any more!

I found that as of PostgreSQL 12, I'm getting back `varchar` data with a 1-byte header! Surprise!

The fix is to stop assuming a 4-byte header. If you want the size of the varlena data area, less the header, use `VARSIZE_ANY_EXHDR` instead of `VARSIZE() - VARHDRSZ`. If you want a pointer into the data area, use `VARDATA_ANY` instead of `VARDATA`. The "any" macros first test the header type, and then apply the appropriate macro.

I have no idea what commit caused short varlena headers to make a comeback, but it was fun figuring out what the heck was going on.
