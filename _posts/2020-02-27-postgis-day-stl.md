Every year, on the second Wednesday of November, Esri ("the Microsoft of GIS") promotes a day of celebration, "[GIS Day](https://www.gisday.com/en-us/overview)" in which the members of our community unite to tell the world about the wonders of cartography and spatial data and incidentally use their software a lot in the process.

And every year, for the last number of years, on the day **after** "GIS Day", a motley crew of open source users and SQL database afficionados observe "PostGIS Day". Until this fall, I had never had a chance to personally participate in a PostGIS Day event, but this year [Crunchy sponsored a day in St Louis](https://info.crunchydata.com/stl-postgis-day-2019-presentations), and I got to talk **an awful lot** about PostGIS.

It was really good, and I feel like there's lots more to be done, if only on the subject of spatial SQL and analysis in the database. Here's the talks I gave, the balance are on the [event page](https://info.crunchydata.com/stl-postgis-day-2019-presentations).
