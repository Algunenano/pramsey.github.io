Here in the Covid-times, I haven't been able to keep up my previous schedule of speaking at conferences, but I have managed to participate in a couple of episodes of the [MapScaping Podcast](https://mapscaping.com/blogs/the-mapscaping-podcast/dynamic-vector-tiles-straight-from-the-database), hosted by [Daniel O'Donohue](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielodonohue/).

* [Dynamic vector tiles straight from the database](https://plnk.to/MapScaping/e/1000470185368) covered the theory of vector tiles in web mapping, and the practical ways to hook up a PostGIS database to the web using [pg_tileserv](https://github.com/crunchydata/pg_tileserv).

* [Spatial SQL - GIS without the GIS](https://mapscaping.com/blogs/the-mapscaping-podcast/spatial-sql-gis-without-the-gis) reviewed some history of SQL, the bestest data language in the wide, wide world, and how SQL fits into the world of geospatial software tools.

Daniel is a great interviewer and really puts together a tight show. So far I've been on two, and I quietly hope to join him again some time in the future.
